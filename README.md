Our submitted web application for the 1st SEM Hackathon, organised by the Software Engineering and Management department of Gothenburg University, Sweden, which took place 5-7 May 2017, which got us 2nd place in the contest.

The Hackathon theme was Eurovision. Our submission has to do with the analysis of the lyrics of the best 5 songs of each year of the contest, in order to determine to lyrical complexity. After this, a graph is created in order to visualise whether or not "popular music lyrics are becoming dumber". There is also the option of comparing your own favorite song against the chart and see how it performs.

Developed using the MEAN stack, except for MongoDB (not necessary)
More specifically, Express for creating the app itself, the routings, NodeJS for the backend support, AngularJS for the frontend.
