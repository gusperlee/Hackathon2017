Girl, girl, girl, can't you see what you do to me tonight?
Boy, boy, boy, if you're mean, I will start a fight tonight
You and I could try to stop – uh boy, till you drop
If we get together now, we'll burn this place down
 
You and me, can't you see, we're playing with fire?
Tell me now, do you feel this burning desire?
Don't stop, make it rock, it's taking us higher
Could it be just a dream? Are you running away?
 
Uh ho... uh ho... uh ho...
 
Boy, boy, boy, what a fight, come and spend with me the night
Girl, girl, girl, are you sure? – Uhu – I ain't here to fight, alright?
You and I could try to stop – uh boy, till you drop
If we get together now, we'll burn this place down
 
You and me, can't you see, we're playing with fire
Tell me now, do you feel this burning desire?
Don't stop, make it rock, it's taking us higher
Could it be just a dream? Are you running away?
 
Uh ho... uh ho... uh ho...
 
You and me, can't you see, we're playing with fire?
Tell me now, do you feel this burning desire?
Don't stop, make it rock, it's taking us higher
Could it be just a dream? Are you running away?
