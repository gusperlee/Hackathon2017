You are my man, you are my half
Tell me what's happening
I know something's wrong
I can tell when you lie
I can tell you've stopped trying
 
And these last three weeks passed and we barely talked
I think I know and it's breaking my heart
Am I in or am I out?
 
Can I love you forever through this?
Can I trust in you forever through this?
I don't know how to stop, how to stop
 
These teardro-o-ops
That drip drop, drip drop
Drip drop, drip drop
Whoah... whoah...
 
These teardro-o-ops
That drip drop, drip drop
Drip drop, drip drop
Whoah... whoah...
 
Tell me where have you been? Why are you late?
You smell like lipstick again
Come on, answer my question
Say something
Why are you acting out?
 
Oh, say it's in my head
 
Can I love you forever through this?
Can I trust in you forever through this?
I don't know how to stop, how to stop
 
These teardro-o-ops
That drip drop, drip drop
Drip drop, drip drop
Whoah... whoah...
 
I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna hear your name
If this is where it ends
I don't wanna run
Run away from myself
And be lost again...
 
(Can I love you forever through this?)
Oh no no no... oh no no no...
Can I trust in you forever through this?
 
I don't know (These teardro-o-ops)
I don't know (That drip drop, drip drop)
I don't know (Drip drop, drip drop)
Whoah... whoah...
