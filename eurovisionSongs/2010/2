For as long as I remember
For as long as I've been blue
Every day since we've been parted
All I thought about was you
 
Didn't need the time for sorrow
Didn't need the time for pain
What am I supposed to do
When living without you
Was the worst I ever knew?
 
In a moment like this
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what you're looking for
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know did you ask for more
Oh... in a moment like this
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what I have to do
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know how to get to you
Oh... in a moment like this
 
Ever since the day you left me
Ooh... ever since you went away
I'm lost and I don't know
Where am I supposed to go?
I still miss you so
 
In a moment like this
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what you're looking for
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know did you ask for more
Oh... in a moment like this
 
When I need for you to hold me
Say you love and never leave me
My heart will forever be true
 
In a moment like this
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what you're looking for
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know did you ask for more
Oh... in a moment like this
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what I have to do
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know how to get to you
Oh... in a moment like this
