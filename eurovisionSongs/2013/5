What if I could change the path of time?
What if I had a power to decide?
What if I could make us unify?
If I, if I...
 
What if we would open up the doors?
What if we could help each other more?
What if I could make you all believe?
If we, if we...
 
What if we all opened our arms?
What if we came together as one?
What if we aimed to stop the alarms?
What if we chose to bury our guns?
 
Why don't we always reach out to those
Who need us the most?
 
Together we can change the path of time
Together we have power to decide
The answer lies within our hearts and minds
Together, together
 
Together we can make a better place
On this little island out in space
Together we can change the world forever
 
What if we all opened our arms?
What if we came together as one?
What if we aimed to stop the alarms?
What if we chose to bury our guns?
 
Let's unite and make a change
Let's unite and write a new page
Come on sinners, come on saints
Have faith
 
Why don't we always reach out to those...
 
What if we all opened our arms?
What if we came together as one?
What if we aimed to stop the alarms?
What if we chose to bury our guns?
 
What if we all opened our arms?
What if we came together as one?
What if we aimed to stop the alarms?
What if we chose to bury our guns?
 
Why don't we always reach out to those
Who need us the most?
