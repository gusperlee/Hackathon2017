Nothing comes from dreams but dreams
Still you believe in wonder
Something happens and it seems
Like a strike of thunder
 
Nothing comes from love but love
Why is it growing stronger?
I am falling from above
I will wait no longer
 
I'm like a butterfly
Spinning round a sword as if to dare
I should have stayed up high
(It's stronger than me) My gravity, my gravity
 
Hey... sha...
Ah yeah... lele...
See... lele...
 
Nothing comes from pride but pride
Mmh... my way is clear
Dancing on the edge tonight
Now I feel no fear
 
I'm like a butterfly
Spinning round a sword as if to dare
I should have stayed up high
(It's stronger than me) My gravity, my gravity
 
I'm like a butterfly (My gravity)
I'm like a butterfly
And I should have stayed up high
(It's stronger than me) My gravity, my gravity
 
Gravity
