Should have seen it coming when I saw you
Should have had the sense to stop and walk away
It was gonna turn out complicated
We've hit overload, about to explode
 
If love was a mountain
I'd climb up to the highest of them all
I'd swim across the ocean if you'd call
I'm lost in your smile
Freefalling for miles
 
Hold me, just unfold me
Unchain my soul, give me love, make me whole
Hold me, if it's only for this moment in time
Now I'm yours and you're mine
So hold me
 
Take a little time then you'll know better
Then to think about giving in on the one you love
Can we go back and freeze the moment?
Where we used to be free, was only you and me
 
Hold me, just unfold me
Unchain my soul, give me love, make me whole
Hold me, if it's only for this moment in time
Now I'm yours and you're mine
 
Remember how we used to laugh
But now you're running from the past
Let's find a way to carry on
Remember how love used to be
You said I was your fantasy
Can't take another night alone
So come on home
 
Hold me, just unfold me
Unchain my soul, give me love, make me whole
Hold me, if it's only for this moment in time
Now I'm yours and you're mine
So hold me
