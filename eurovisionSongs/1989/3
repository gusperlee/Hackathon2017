No more sad songs for me to sing
No more heartaches for you to bring me
No more being the hurting kind
I am running where you won't find me
 
Whenever I was lonely, I'd call you up and then
I would soon regret my momentary weakness
But it feels so strong
Why do I always get it wrong?
 
No more sad songs on lonely nights
No more seeking the wrongs or rights of it
No more playing the fool for you
You can do what you wanna do now
 
Whenever I was lonely, I'd call you up and then
I would soon regret my momentary weakness
But it feels so strong
Why do I always get it wrong?
 
(No more sad songs, no more heartache)
(I am running where you can't find me)
No more sad songs for me to sing
(No more sad songs, no more heartache)
No more heartaches, no more heartaches
So now you can't hurt me
(I am running where you can't find me)
 
Sometimes I wish that we had never met
(No more sad songs, no more heartache)
'Cause you're my weakness, you're my weakness
You're my one and only regret
(I am running where you can't find me)
 
I am runnin', runnin', runnin' where you won't find me
(No more sad songs, no more heartache)
Don't wanna play the fool for you
(I am running where you can't find me)
So go on your way, do what you gotta do
 
(No more sad songs, no more heartache)
(I am running where you can't find me)
(No more sad songs, no more heartache)
(I am running where you can't find me)
