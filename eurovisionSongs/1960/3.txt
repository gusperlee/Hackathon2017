That night you only had your youth
To offer me like a bouquet of spring
In the love that often disappointed me
I didn't believe anymore, but when I saw you...
 
That night I wanted to invent
Words that had never existed
Words of love in full dress
For that night
 
In your arms, I understood that from that night
Life would never have attraction for me
Far from you
 
My love, I have given you the best
The best of the deepest of my heart
Of my heart that is still saving the tenderness
Of that night
 
That night, but what good is returning?
All that is for me only a memory
But I've never been able to free myself from a crazy dream
That I cherised
 
I had given you much more than my life
But maybe you didn't understand
That you tore my childhood dream
By leaving me
 
And still if you come back to me one day
In my heart, I save like the first day
So much love
 
So much love always for you who I'm waiting for
Who I'm waiting for like someone waiting for spring
Spring, my arms full of lilacs
For that night
 
My love, I'll wait for you every day
As long as I live, I'll be there
That night
