Good night, my darling
Good night, please dream of me
Good night, my darling
Even in your dreams, I'll always be with you
 
My love will accompany you everywhere
Wherever you may be, I'll be with you
Good night, my darling
Good night, I'll never forget you
 
At the big fiesta
A dream came true for me
And the rhythm of the music
Doesn't go out of my head
Because I was happy with you
 
Good night, my darling
Good night, my darling
Even in your dreams, I'll always be with you
 
My love will accompany you everywhere
Wherever you may be, I'll be with you
Good night, my darling
Good night, I'll never forget you
 
I'll never forget you
I'll never forget you
