Tom Pillibi has two castles – the first one in Scotland
Tom Pillibi has two castles – the other one in Montenegro
He also has two ships which go to the end of the world
To search for gold and corals and the most beautiful jewels
 
He's lucky – Tom Pillibi
And I think that I'm his girlfriend
He's so rich, that I envy him
He's so rich – blasted Tom Pillibi
 
Tom Pillibi has two secrets, which he won't tell anyone
Tom Pillibi has two secrets – I'm the only one who knows them
The king's daughter smiles to him and waits for him in her bedroom
The king's daughter smiles to him and the shepherdess too
 
He's lucky – Tom Pillibi
And I think that I'm his girlfriend
Which good star is looking after him?
Which good star? – Blasted Tom Pillibi
 
Tom Pillibi has only one fault, but it's nothing serious
Tom Pillibi has only one fault, but it's not such a big thing
He's charming, he's kind-hearted, he has so much courage
He's charming, he's kind-hearted, but he's such a liar
 
Because nothing exists of all that
But I don't care when I'm in his arms
Because I'm the queen of the big country
Where he takes me to – blasted Tom Pillibi
