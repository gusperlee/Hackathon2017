In a little valley, far up North
Where the sun shines all night long
In a little valley, way up North
I heard a Sami girl sing
 
It seems the song arrived on a wind
The wind from the south brought it over the sea
The girl was so fair and light at heart
And rhythm was her gift at the cradle
 
In a little valley, happy as few others were
I heard a song that went like this:
 
Voi voi, way up in the mountains
Can you hear this greeting from me
Voi voi, I want to tell you that I'm waiting for you
Voi voi, time is standing still
When I'm waiting for my sweetheart
Voi voi, our fate was that I were to be yours
 
Voi voi, in a few days it will be Saturday you know
Voi voi, then a wonderful dream will become reality
Voi, soon you'll come down to the valley and your sweetheart
Voi voi, the week is over, saturday night will be nice
Saturday night will be nice
 
Voi voi, in a few days it will be Saturday you know
Voi voi, then a beautiful dream will become reality
Voi, soon you'll come down to the valley and your sweetheart
Voi voi, the week is over, saturday night will be nice
Saturday night will be nice, saturday night will be nice
 
Voi voi
