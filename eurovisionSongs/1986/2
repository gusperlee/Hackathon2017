You, who look for the star
You, who live a dream
You, heroes of space
With a heart bigger than earth
You, give me my chance
Take me far away from here...

Don't leave without me
Let me follow you
You, who fly to other existences
Let me live

The most beautiful adventure
The most beautiful voyage
Which will lead one day
To suns, to planets
Of love

You, the new poets
You, the magic birds
You, maybe you will
Find new music
You, give me my chance
I want to sing too...

Don't leave without me
Let me follow you
You, who fly to other existences
Let me live

The blue of infinity
The joy of being free
On rays, on suns
On songs, on wonders
And in a sky
Of love

The blue of infinity
The joy of being free
You, who look for another existence
You, who fly towards the year two thousand
Don't leave without me
