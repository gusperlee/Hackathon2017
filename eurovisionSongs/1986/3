I never felt like this before
Seein' you again only makes me sad
I recall the times when we
Were in love and had everything
It makes me so sad
 
Time is meant to heal the pain
I thought was gone
Seein' you again has made it carry on
 
Go before you break my heart once more
I know that's what you come here for
Go before you say 'I love you' the way you did
The day before you walked away from me
 
Lookin' back on the times we had
Things were beautiful then
But how quick they've changed
One day you were in love with me
Then the next, so suddenly, he came along
 
Time is meant to heal the pain
I thought was gone
Seein' you again has made it carry on, yeah
 
Go before you break my heart once more
I know that's what you come here for
Go before you say 'I love you' the way you did
The day before you walked away from me
 
(Go before you break my heart once more)
Just go, just go away
(I know that's what you come here for)
Just leave me behind to face another day
Go before you say 'I love you' the way you did
The day before you walked away from me
 
The day before you walked away from me
