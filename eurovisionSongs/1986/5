No, I don't want to sing on crying lyrics
Such as the sound of a too dark violin
We, we see life with the eyes of the heart
Nothing can keep us from believing in it

Believing in the new world we have in our heads
Believing in us in order to change tomorrow
Even believing in lies if this can stop them
Believing in the lines in our hands

Believing in the sky filled up with birds
Still believing in the space between your arms
Believing in the colour of your skin
Believing that we won't march in step anymore

Believing that we're twenty
Believing that we can build a volcanic ground
Believing that we can scream

When we have love within us
