Stop, don't say that it's impossible
'Cause I know it's possible
Though I know you never look my way
I can say you will one day
I can say you will one day
 
I will be popular, I will be popular
I'm gonna get there, popular
My body wants you, girl
My body wants you, girl
I'll get you when I'm popular
 
I put my hands up in the light
You see me dancing for my life
I will be popular, I will be popular
I'm gonna get there, popular
 
Spread the news, I'm gonna take the fight
For the spotlight, day and night
I can take this to the number one
Be someone before you're gone
Be someone before you're gone
 
I will be popular, I will be popular
I'm gonna get there, popular
My body wants you girl
My body wants you girl
I'll get you when I'm popular
 
I put my hands up in the light
You see me dancing for my life
I will be popular, I will be popular
I'm gonna get there, popular
 
Oh pop... oh pop... oh popular
Oh pop... oh pop... oh popular
Oh pop... oh pop... oh popular
Oh, oh...
 
I will be popular, I will be popular
I'm gonna get there
My body wants you, girl
My body wants you, girl
I'll get you when I'm popular
 
I put my hands up in the light
You see me dancing for my life
I will be popular, I will be popular
Popular
 
Oh pop... oh pop... oh popular
Oh, oh...
