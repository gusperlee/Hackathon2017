When you look into my eyes
World becomes a better place
And you know deep inside
Love is taking all the space
Baby, I love you... and you?
 
We are birds, we fly so high and we are falling down
When I dream of you, my dream is so fearless
We are people of the planet, we live human lives
We are angels, we're in danger, we are crystal white, crystal white
 
When you look into my eyes
Sun is touching mountain top
When you look into my eyes
It will never have to stop
Baby, I love you... and you?
 
We are birds, we fly so high and we are falling down
When I dream of you, my dream is so fearless
We are people of the planet, we live human lives
We are angels, we're in danger, we are crystal white, crystal white
 
We are birds, we fly so high and we are falling down
When I dream of you, my dream is so fearless
We are people of the planet, we live human lives
We are angels, we're in danger, we are crystal white, crystal white
