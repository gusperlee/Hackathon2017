Don't yawn from sleep or boredom
I'm your wife and I eat out of your hand
But I don't eat from charity

Don't look at me as if you think: 'are you still alive?'
Am I still that woman
With whom you once - when was it again? -
Wanted to have that little adventure at all costs?

Be nice once again, just like then
Ask me once again for a kiss
Bring me roses again, blush again
When you see me, just like then
Be nice and gallant once again
Find me beautiful and charming again
Then the world will be just like before
A fairyland

Yes, you're getting fat and your hair is turning grey
But you still can flirt, believe me
Ah, sometimes you act like a child, so silly
Gruff and wanton by turn

Do you remember? Do you remember? Don't say no now
Do you remember, that you said then?
The happiest couple, that's the both of us
My love, dearest darling, never ends

Be nice once again, just like then
Ask me once again for a kiss
Bring me roses again, blush again
When you see me, just like then
Be nice and gallant once again
Find me beautiful and charming again
Then the world will be just like before
A fairyland
