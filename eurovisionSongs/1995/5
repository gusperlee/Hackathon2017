Let me know when
All the trains are leaving
Cause I want to wake up with you
Now the snow has incarcerated me

Just a winter away
Cold and clear as ice
Send your thoughts to me
Cause my heart is pounding

From Mols to Skagen, from Mols to Skagen
From Mols to Skagen, I'm missing you
And your silky sheets
And breakfast on blue balconies
There will be no wild swans
As long as this snow keeps falling

You were everything to me
Now I am quiet and pale
You are the Emperor of the Sun
My dreams are soaring

From Mols to Skagen, from Mols to Skagen,
From Mols to Skagen, I'm missing you
And your silky sheets
And breakfast on blue balconies
There will be no wild swans
As long as this snow keeps falling

Silky sheets
And breakfast on blue balconies
There will be no wild swans
As long as this snow keeps falling

Silky sheets
(From Mols to Skagen)
And breakfast on blue balconies
(From Mols to Skagen)
There will be no wild swans
As long as this snow keeps falling
