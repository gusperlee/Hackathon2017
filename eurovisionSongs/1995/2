I've felt the emptiness
And a sleeping memory arouses again
You're not with me
And so much loneliness is hurting me inside
Who knows where you are?
Who knows where you are?

Come, come, come back to me
Come, come, because I need your love
Come, I can't forget you
Come back to me, my love

Nothing remains in my soul
Except for this flame that will never die
That burns in my chest
When, alone in my bed
I feel you're not there
You have to listen to me
You have to listen to me

Come, come, come back to me
Come, come, because I need your love
Come, come back to me
Give heat to this winter

Come, come, come back to me
Come, come, I've already asked your forgiveness
(Come) Come, I can't forget you
Come back to me, my love

Oh... (Come, come, come back to me)
(Come, come, because I need your love)
Come, come, come (Come, come, come back to me)
(Give this winter heat) Oh, yeah, yeah

Come, come, come back to me
Come, come, I've already asked your forgiveness
(Come) Come, I can't forget you
Come back to me, my love
