His three bunches of flowers at the door of my home
A poem written for me as lyrics of a song
His voice at the answering machine round four AM
Tells me: "My sweetheart, lots of kisses, everything's fine"
I'm waiting for him, a bit like a thief waiting for the good hour
I have the idea that this man is a sweetie or a charmer

He makes a date with me, often he tells me politely
"If you will permit me, miss"
"To put a kiss, a jewel on your neck"
"Something eternal"
He makes a date with me, then I admit
That I feel wings growing on me
And the Good Lord is jealous of this angel who is a bit crazy
It makes me believe in heaven
He makes a date with me as if he would give his life
Before him, I've always been on first-name terms

It's an airline ticket bound for the Marquesas Islands
Because I've said no to New York and Venice
It's a big limousine parked at the bottom of the elevator
He's also capable to desguise himself as a chauffeur
He's a bit dandy, a bit hooligan, a bit crazy
But I am, as they say, the singer of his dance band

He makes a date with me, often he tells me politely
"If you will permit me, miss"
"To put a kiss, a jewel on your neck"
"Something eternal"
He makes a date with me, then I admit
That I feel wings growing on me
And the Good Lord is jealous of this angel who is a bit crazy
It makes me believe in heaven
He makes a date with me as if he would give his life
Before him, I've always been on first-name terms

He makes a date with me, often he tells me politely
"If you will permit me, miss"
"To put a kiss, a jewel on your neck"
"Something eternal"
He makes a date with me, then I admit
That I feel wings growing on me
And the Good Lord is jealous of this angel who is a bit crazy
It makes me believe in heaven
It makes me believe in heaven
It makes me believe in heaven
