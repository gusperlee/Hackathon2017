When your journey is long and you are weary
But you still have to go on, mmm...
And when the shadows start to grow and come to life
And when the night scares you so
I am beside you and I follow every step you take
And with you I'll stay

So look at me, oho... a haven in the storm
Like a wave, that is born to carry you
Yes, look at me, oho... in light and darkness
I'll be there and I'll never leave you

When you stand one day at a crossroads of your life
Like a lost little child
I am beside you and I follow every step you take
And I'll stay with you

So look at me, oho... a haven in the storm
Like a wave, that is born to carry you
Yes, look at me, oho... in light and darkness
I'll be there and I'll never leave you

I'll go with you wherever you go, and I'll never leave you

So look at me, oho... a haven in the storm
Like a wave, that is born to love you
Yes, look at me, when the light turns into darkness in your life
I'll be there, and I'll never leave you
Love you so
