Nobody but me, could know the way I feel
 
I'm standing on the rooftop
And I'm crying out your name
I'm looking for an answer
And for somebody to blame
'Cause even though it's over
You linger on my mind, oh
 
Hurts, oh it hurts, really hurts
In the middle of the night
In the light of the day
You know that it hurts
Oh it hurts, really hurts
And I wish I could be stronger
No longer afraid
Nobody but me, could know the way I feel
Oh it hurts, oh it hurts
 
I'm trying to forget love
The pain I feel inside
I'm clinging to my pillow
And the tears I cannot hide
I wish it could be over
So I can start anew, oh
 
Hurts, oh it hurts, really hurts
In the middle of the night
In the light of the day
You know that it hurts
Oh it hurts, really hurts
And I wish I could be stronger
No longer afraid
Nobody but me, could know the way I feel
Oh it hurts, oh
 
Not easy to remember
And even harder to forget
Whenever I surrender (whenever I surrender)
Oh, you're always on my mind...
 
(Hurts, oh it hurts, really hurts)
In the middle of the night
In the light of the day
You know that it hurts
Oh it hurts, really hurts
And I wish I could be stronger
No longer afraid
Nobody but me, could know the way I feel
Oh it hurts, ooh it hurts
I wish I could be stronger
Oh, but it hurts
