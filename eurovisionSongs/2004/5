No matter where I am
I'm always thinking of you
It may be hard, but I need you to understand
That I don't often say what I feel
But now this is straight from my heart
 
My love grows stronger every minute
And it won't ever die
I want you to stay with me
Not just this day, but for all my life
 
Now, when I look into your eyes
I can tell there's something wrong
You're holding back the tears
Couldn't bare to lose you now
So I will make my feelings clear
 
My love grows stronger every minute
And it won't ever die
You must believe I'll always be there
For you, all my life
 
Oh... please stay
Mmm...
 
My love grows stronger every minute
And it won't ever die
I want you to stay with me
Not just this day, but for all my life
 
Oh... please stay
