When I think of you
I'm afraid of loving you again
I sink my teeth into my blue lips
To forget the real pain

My sweetheart, these days
I don't even wallow in sorrow any more
I only ask if you are alone
People I can't hear

My sweetheart, leave tonight
It's not important, with anyone
Find someone who resembles me
So at least I won't love you

(May someone else kiss your lips)
(So I can get over you more easily)

My sweetheart, these days (My sweetheart)
I don't even wallow in sorrow any more (My sweetheart)
I only ask if you are alone
People I can't hear

My sweetheart, leave tonight (My sweetheart)
It's not important, with anyone
Find someone who resembles me
So at least I won't love you
So I will no longer love you
