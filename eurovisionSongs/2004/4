Everytime you wanna play
Turn me on, all the way
Come to me and take the ride
Skin on skin, it's pure delight
Givin' me the passion, you're burning my heart
Gonna rock you till you drop
Baby, you're the reason I'm feeling so hot
Want you now, I just can't stop
 
I would trade my life
For a night with you
Driven by desire
Make that move on me
It's time for you to see
That my world's on fire
 
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it, mi amor
Crazy for love
Give me some more
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it, mi amor
Crazy for love
Give me some more
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it, mi amor
Crazy for love
Give me some more
Forever

Forever
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 
Everyday I can't resist
Need the taste of your lips
Darlin', it's your body that's driving me nuts
Let me in, I've got to touch
 
I would trade my life
For a night with you
Driven by desire
Make that move on me
It's time for you to see
That my world's on fire
 
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it, mi amor
Crazy for love
