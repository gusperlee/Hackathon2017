Oh... come on up, come on up, come on up now
What you doin', what you waitin' for?
Oh... it's time to push it, break it, rush it
Don't ever let life pass you by
 
All I know is you don't want to be part of the crowd
Realise yourself
 
You say it but don't feel it
What you sayin' has no meanin'
Don't hide your soul
For real, I'm for real
Come on up
 
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
Do you want? Do you want?
Up, I wanna bring you up, up
I wanna bring you up
 
Please, please, no questions, no answers
No more running around in circles
Are you in? Are you out?
Do you know your way out?
Let me take you up in the sky
 
For real, I'm for real
Come on up
 
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
Do you want? Do you want?
Up, I wanna bring you up, up
I wanna bring you up
 
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
Do you want? Do you want?
Up, I wanna bring you up, up
I wanna bring you...
 
Come on, come on
Risin' up now, risin' up now
