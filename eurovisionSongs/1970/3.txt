A lot of people ask: what's the reason?
Why does happiness never come to me?
Making far too little of life
When all the time happiness is near

Miracles keep happening, again and again
Today or tomorrow they can occur
Miracles keep happening, again and again
When one happens to you, you also have to see it

Many people seek each and every day
Someone who gives his heart to you
And just when they're thinking he will never come
They find someone who loves them

Miracles keep happening, again and again
Today or tomorrow they can occur
Miracles keep happening, again and again
When one happens to you, you also have to see it

Miracles keep happening, again and again
Today or tomorrow they can occur
Miracles keep happening, again and again
When one happens to you, you also have to see it
