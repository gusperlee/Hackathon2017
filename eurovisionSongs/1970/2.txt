Tears of rain run down my window pane
I'm on my own again, good evening, sorrow
Sit and dream of how things might have been
And as I close my eyes, I get the strangest feeling
 
Knock, knock, who's there?
Could this be love that's calling?
The door is always open wide
Knock, knock, who's there?
Now as the night is falling
Take off your coat and come inside
 
Climb the stair and then I say a prayer
For someone who could share my situation
But instead as I lay down my head
I have to leave it all to my imagination
 
Knock, knock, who's there?
Could this be love that's calling?
The door is always open wide
Knock, knock, who's there?
Now as the night is falling
Take off your coat and come inside
 
La lala lalala la lala...
Lalala la lala lalala lala...
La lala lalala la lala...
Lalala la lala lalala lala...
 
Sit and dream of how things might have been
And as I close my eyes, I get the strangest feeling
 
Knock, knock, who's there?
Could this be love that's calling?
The door is always open wide
Knock, knock, who's there?
Now as the night is falling
Take off your coat and come inside
 
Take off your coat and come inside
