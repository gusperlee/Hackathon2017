It's the time that the frosty pearls settle
That every leaf thinks to be a rose
Somewhere a bird sings something
And Marie-Blanche is mine

We're there in a soft stillness
We've put an end to our loneliness
Our bodies learn tender habits
And Marie-Blanche is mine

And Marie-Blanche is mine, and I love her
And Marie-Blanche falls asleep near me

The snow falls and the wind escorts her
Every pond is frozen, yes, but what does it matter
In the winter we closed our door
And Marie-Blanche is mine

And Marie-Blanche is mine, and I love her
And Marie-Blanche falls asleep near me

Oh, may the time turn its pages
We'll stay there for a century or longer
The city sleeps under the wing of white clouds
And Marie-Blanche is mine

I don't want to know a thing about the rest of the world
The earth never seemed so round to me
Against my heart, there's her blonde hair
And Marie-Blanche is mine
