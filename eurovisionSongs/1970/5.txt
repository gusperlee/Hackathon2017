\f0\fs24 \cf0 It's the time that the frosty pearls settle\
That every leaf thinks to be a rose\
Somewhere a bird sings something\
And Marie-Blanche is mine\
\
We're there in a soft stillness\
We've put an end to our loneliness\
Our bodies learn tender habits\
And Marie-Blanche is mine\
\
And Marie-Blanche is mine, and I love her\
And Marie-Blanche falls asleep near me\
\
The snow falls and the wind escorts her\
Every pond is frozen, yes, but what does it matter\
In the winter we closed our door\
And Marie-Blanche is mine\
\
And Marie-Blanche is mine, and I love her\
And Marie-Blanche falls asleep near me\
\
Oh, may the time turn its pages\
We'll stay there for a century or longer\
The city sleeps under the wing of white clouds\
And Marie-Blanche is mine\
\
I don't want to know a thing about the rest of the world\
The earth never seemed so round to me\
Against my heart, there's her blonde hair\
And Marie-Blanche is mine}
