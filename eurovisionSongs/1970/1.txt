Snowdrops and daffodils, butterflies and bees
Sailboats and fishermen, things of the sea
Wishing wells, wedding bells, early morning dew
All kinds of everything remind me of you
 
Seagulls and aeroplanes, things of the sky
Winds that go howling, breezes that sigh
City sights, neon lights, grey skies or blue
All kinds of everything remind me of you
 
Summertime, wintertime
Spring and autumn too
Monday, Tuesday, every day
I think of you
 
Dances, romances, things of the night
Sunshine and holidays, postcards to write
Budding trees, autumn leaves, a snowflake or two
All kinds of everything remind me of you
 
Summertime, wintertime
Spring and autumn too
Seasons will never change
The way that I love you
 
Dances, romances, things of the night
Sunshine and holidays, postcards to write
Budding trees, autumn leaves, a snowflake or two
All kinds of everything remind me of you
All kinds of everything remind me of you
