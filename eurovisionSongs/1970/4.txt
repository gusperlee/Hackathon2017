You wait for me at least every night
And I take the train to Italy
I'll stay there for ten days, neither very long nor too short
It's a bit far, I know, but take care
On my return, I'll have in a jewel case
The photos of my girlfriends
And Italy will be well worth some nights

Pa pa ba pa pa pa... pa pa ba pa pa...
Pa pa pa pa pa... pa pa pa ba pa pa...
Pa pa pa pa pa pa... pa pa ba pa pa...
Pa pa pa pa pa... pa pa pa ba pa pa...

You care more for a soul mate than for a sister
And I'm careful with your heart
I'm about to leave for England
It's a bit far, I know, but take care
On my return, I'll have in a jewel box
Two or three caprioles and some little curls
And your pain will be well worth my ardour

Pa pa ba pa pa pa... pa pa ba pa pa...
Pa pa pa pa pa... pa pa pa ba pa pa...
Pa pa pa pa pa pa... pa pa ba pa pa...
Pa pa pa pa pa... pa pa pa ba pa pa...

You give your love better than a mother
And I play deaf, like taking air
I go to conquer all the cuties
That's not nothing, I know, but take care
On my return, I'll have in a jewel case
A great experience, you can trust on me
And our love will be well worth a detour

Pa pa ba pa pa pa... pa pa ba pa pa...
Pa pa pa pa pa... pa pa pa ba pa pa...
Pa pa pa pa pa pa... pa pa ba pa pa...
Pa pa pa pa pa... pa pa pa ba pa pa...

You close your eyes to my absence
You don't speak much, you are the mercy
I know that between all, at the end of my routes
I'll keep for you, in the bottom of my heart
A special place, like a flower
And then a ring, that will make people jealous
And your love will be well worth my return

Pa pa ba pa pa pa... pa pa ba pa pa...
Pa pa pa pa pa... pa pa pa ba pa pa...
Pa pa pa pa pa pa... pa pa ba pa pa...
Pa pa pa pa pa... pa pa pa ba pa pa...
