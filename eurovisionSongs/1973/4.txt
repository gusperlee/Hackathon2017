The middle of the night has come and I am awake
Dreams come to the threshold
It's the silence before the storm
Let's go now

There – there I saw a rainbow
There – there the morning rises in white
Somewhere – there we'll find the garden together
The garden of love

There – there I heard an sweet old melody
There – there is a moon every night
There – there we'll find the garden together
The garden of love

Tonight my house is wrapped by the winds
Holding it from every side
We fly beyond the clouds
Hand holding hand

Tonight a new day is knocking at my heart
And you are drawing nearer with it
Together we'll ask for the azure gardens
We'll come to their gates

There – there I saw a rainbow
There – there the morning rises in white
Somewhere – there we'll find the garden together
The garden of love

There – there we'll find the garden together
The garden of love
