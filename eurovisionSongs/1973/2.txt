\f0\fs24 \cf0 Like a promise, you are, you are\
Like a summer morning\
Like a smile, you are, you are\
Like that, like that, you are\
\
All my hope, you are, you are\
Like fresh rain in my hands\
Like a strong breeze, you are, you are\
Like that, like that, you are\
\
You are like the water of my fountain\
You are the fire of my hearth\
\
(You are...) Something like that you are\
(Like the fire of my bonfire)\
Something like the fire of my bonfire\
(You are...) Something like that you are\
(The wheat of my bread)\
My life, something like that, you are\
\
Like my poem, you are, you are\
Like a guitar in the night\
My whole horizon, you are, you are\
Like that, like that, you are\
\
(Nananana... nananana na...)\
\
You are like the water of my fountain\
You are the fire of my hearth\
\
(You are...) Something like that you are\
(Like the fire of my bonfire)\
Something like the fire of my bonfire\
(You are...) Something like that you are\
(The wheat of my bread)\
My life, something like that, you are\
\
(You are...) Something like that you are\
(Like the water of my fountain)\
Something like the water of my fountain\
You are the fire of my hearth}
