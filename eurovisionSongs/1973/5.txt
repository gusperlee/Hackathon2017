Monday morning – the streets are black with rain
Under a skylight hovers sad and grey
Tuesday waits down the endless dreary lane
And every day is like the other day
 
I am blue and I long for your caress
Oh... your breasts are like swallows a-nestling
You're the summer, life grows in you, summer wind blows in you
Summer rains flow in you, summer sings low in you
You are summer, you never tell me no
Summer, life grows in you, summer wind blows in you
Summer, you never tell me no
 
Times are stale and the days are long and slow
There is no song can make me laugh and sing
Half past four, I pack up and home I go
Home to the void and fear the evenings bring
 
I am blue and I long for your caress
Oh... your breasts are like swallows anestling
You're the summer, life grows in you, summer wind blows in you
Summer rains flow in you, summer sings low in you
You are summer, you never tell me no
Summer, life grows in you, summer wind blows in you
Summer, you never tell me no
 
I am blue and I long for your caress
Oh... your breasts are like swallows anestling
You're the summer, life grows in you, summer wind blows in you
Summer rains flow in you, summer sings low in you
You are summer, you never tell me no
 
You are summer, you never tell me no
