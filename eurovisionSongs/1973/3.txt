Power to all our friends
To the music that never ends
To the people we want to be
Baby, power to you and me
 
There's one old man
Spends his life growing flowers
And caring for the bees
Power to the bees
There's one old lady
Spent her days making wine
The wine tasted fine
Power to the vine
 
Power to the boys who played rock 'n' roll
And made my life so sweet
And to the girls I knew before
And those I've yet to meet
 
Power to all our friends
To the music that never ends
To the people we want to be
Baby, power to you and me
 
There's one strong man
Ploughing in the valley
He's living off the land
Power to the land
 
There's some young girl
Layin' down in Monte Carlo
Layin' in the sun
Power to the sun
 
Power to the boys who played rock 'n' roll
And made my life so sweet
And to the girls I knew before
And those I've yet to meet
 
Power to all our friends
To the music that never ends
To the people we want to be
Baby, power to you and me
 
Power to the boys who played rock 'n' roll
And made my life so sweet
And to the girls I knew before
And those I've yet to meet
 
Power to all our friends
To the music that never ends
To the people we want to be
Baby, power to you and me
 
To the music that never ends
Baby, power to all our friends
