I couldn't find the words to keep you
But I'm thinking to myself
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
When I was talking a lot of nonsense
It wasn't my voice
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
 
In the darkest of summer, when the storm has fallen
The forests bloom again
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
If your heart and your body still remember
A last time
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
 
Love sometimes made fortresses fall down
Death sometimes made the living find themselves
My joy and my sadness, gone with the wind
Come back to me, you, I'm waiting for you
 
You, my bread, my sun, that stole my sleep
With you, give it back to me
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
If your heart and your body still remember
A last time
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
 
And if my voice arrives there with you
Retrace your steps, your steps, your steps
Come back to me
