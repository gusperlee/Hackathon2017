You're almost made for me, painted for me, Claudia
But I confess that I like you most, Nadia
I like everything of everyone, huhu lalala... always
I can never decide, and so I'm in trouble
 
I'm thinking of you and I see skies without clouds
And a thousand mandolins are caressing me
Then I open my eyes and that moment I realise that
There is no one, there is no one next to me
 
In love with you, wanting you, Laura
I'm not beautiful, but is it my fault, Julia?
On my mouth I have huhu lalala... kisses for you
And I'm dedicating them to the first one who will say yes
 
On my mouth I have huhu lalala... kisses for you
And I'm dedicating them to the first one who will say yes
 
And I'm dedicating them to the first one who will say yes
