A ray of sunshine in a puddle
A little kiss on the cheek from a wind
And the rush, humming
That life's beginning
Its web in your mind
 
A whistle of silver from a treetop
A faint sound of a cat grabbing
A ripple in the stream
A whisper in the hedge
That says, that it isn't night anymore
 
The meadow is wet with dew
Lady Dawn goes to bed
Day gets up playfully
And crossing the bridge of the sun
 
And the two of us?
What about the two of us?
Yes, what about the two of us, you and me?
I'm dancing and dancing and stopping
And sensing only you
Why ever did you run away?
 
Come back, come back
Come back, you my beloved friend
Come back, come back
Wherever you wish, are we dancing to
 
Come, let us dance
Everything can happen
Come, let us dance
Let us dance, let us laugh
 
A whistle of silver from a treetop
A faint sound of a cat grabbing
A ripple in the stream
A whisper in the hedge
That says, that it isn't night anymore
 
The meadow is wet with dew
Lady Dawn goes to bed
Day gets up playfully
And crossing the bridge of the sun
 
And the two of us?
What about the two of us?
Yes, what about the two of us, you and me?
I'm dancing and dancing and stopping
And sensing only you
Why ever did you run away?
Come back, come back
 
Beloved friend
