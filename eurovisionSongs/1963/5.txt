She was so pretty, that I didn't dare to love her
She was so pretty, I can't forget her
She was too pretty when the wind took her
She escaped full of delight and the wind told me:
 
She's very pretty, and I know you
You couldn't love her all your life
Yes, but she's gone, it's a shame, but it's true
She was so pretty, I'll never forget
 
Today it's autumn and I often cry
Today it's autumn and the spring is far away
In the park where the leaves tremble in the ill wind
Her dress swirls, then she disappears
 
She was so pretty, that I didn't dare to love her
She was so pretty, I can't forget her
She was too pretty when the wind took her
She was so pretty, I'll never forget
