We, people from the plains
Excellent drivers in the city
Are always a little scared of the sea
Because of the idea of too much freedom

And although we have the salt in our hair
We have the depth of the sea in our souls
And freezing women in their shawls
Waiting for something which nobody knows

People of the sea, who leave it behind
Going to where they like, they don't know where
People dying of nostalgia
But when they go back after one day, they die
Of the desire to go away

(People of the sea)
And when we stop on the shore
(People who go)
Our look goes to the horizon
(People of the sea)
Bringing our thoughts adrift
Because of the idea of too much freedom

People of the sea, who leave it behind
Going to where they like, they don't know where
Buccaneer people who are no more
Faraway people carrying in their hearts
This big blue brother

At the other side of the sea, there's someone who
There's someone who knows nothing about you

People of the sea, who leave it behind
Going to where they like, they don't know where
We, prisoners of these cities
We always live for today and for yesterday
Nailed down by reality
And the people of the sea go

(People of the sea, who leave it behind) Who leave it behind
(Going where they like) They don't know where
We, prisoners of these big cities
We always live for today and for yesterday
Nailed down by reality
And the people of the sea go
