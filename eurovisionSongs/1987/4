I wanna dance, oh...
I'm up for a dance, oh yeah

In a café right here by the sea
I was drinking some juice
And over there by the bar, on an old jukebox
Some rock was playing

From out of nowhere he appears, I hear him say:
"This is okay" ("This is okay")
Our eyes meet, and he says hey

I hear something like: "Do you wanna dance?"
I think he's asking me if I want to dance
(I wanna dance) Oh...
I'm up for a dance, oh yeah

I hear something like: "Do you wanna dance?"
I think he's asking me if I want to dance
(I wanna dance) Oh...
I'm up for a dance, oh yeah

I wanna dance, oh...
I'm up for a dance, oh yeah

In a café right here by the sea
I was drinking some juice
Down there at the beach, some guys in a band
Were playing some rock

And he appears again, I can hear him say:
"This is okay" ("This is okay")
Our eyes meet, and he says hey

I hear something like: "Do you wanna dance?"
I think he's asking me if I want to dance
(I wanna dance) Oh...
I'm up for a dance, oh yeah

I hear something like: "Do you wanna dance?"
I think he's asking me if I'm up for a dance
(I wanna dance) Oh...
I'm up for a dance, oh yeah
I wanna dance, oh...
I'm up for a dance, oh yeah
I wanna dance
