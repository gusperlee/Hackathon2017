When the door fell shut
A shivering went here through the house
And the trembling went very deeply into my heart
Oh, it knocked me out, I almost counted myself out
And the value of being happy was adjusted
And the clock always ticked the word 'over'

But upright in the wind
I'll remain standing
I'll go on
Just believe me
Whether it's with or without you
Upright in the wind
Even if it's a hurricane
If you can no longer find any solid ground
I'll still stand upright in the wind
(Upright in the wind)

When the door fell shut
I told myself: "Don't look back no more"
Raise the bridge, make a fortress of your heart
And restrain your tears, save them for the night
When you're still hoping and waiting in the wild darkness
But that'll pass over, once that'll go over too

But upright in the wind
I'll remain standing
I'll go on
Just believe me
Whether it's with or without you
Upright in the wind
Even if it's a hurricane
If you can no longer find any solid ground
I'll still stand upright in the wind

If you can no longer find any solid ground
I'll still stand upright in the wind
(Upright in the wind)
Upright in the wind
(Upright in the wind)
Upright in the wind
