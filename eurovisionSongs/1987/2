Let the sun into your heart
Send your longing to heaven
Give your dreams a little freedom
Let the sun into your heart

Sometimes you feel sad and you don't know why
Thousands of little reasons are making you dumb
You nearly forgot what it's like to be a human being
But you are not alone

Let the sun into your heart
Send your longing to heaven
Give your dreams a little freedom
Let the sun into your heart

Sometimes in the nights anger makes you blind
And feelings die like a candlelight in the wind
And you are losing courage, because fear comes over you
But you are not alone

Let the sun into your heart
Send your longing to heaven
Give your dreams a little freedom
Let the sun into your heart

You have to believe in yourself, you don't need pity
And you have to love your life, because you only have one
Never stand in the shadow again, go into the light
You are not alone

Let the sun into your heart
Send your longing to heaven
Go into the light with open arms
Let the sun into your heart

Let the sun into your heart
Send your longing to heaven
Give your dreams a little freedom
Let the sun, let the sun
Let the sun into your heart
