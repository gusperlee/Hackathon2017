Don't, don't close your heart to how you feel
Dream, and don't be afraid the dream's not real
Close your eyes, pretend it's just the two of us again
Make believe this moment's here to stay
 
Touch, touch me the way you used to do
I know tonight could be all I'll have with you
From now on, you'll be with someone else instead of me
So tonight, let's fill this memory
For the last time
 
Hold me now
Don't cry, don't say a word
Just hold me now
And I will know
Though we're apart
We'll always be together
Forever in love
What do you say when words are not enough?
 
Time, time will be kind once we're apart
And your tears, tears will have no place in your heart
I wish I... I could say how much I'll miss you when you're gone
How my love for you will go on and on and
 
Hold me now
Don't cry, don't say a word
Just hold me now
And try to understand that
 
I hope at last you've found
What you've been searchin' for
And though I won't be there anymore
I will always love you
 
(Hold me now)
(Don't cry) Don't say a word
Just hold me now
And I will know
Though we're apart
We'll always be together
Forever in love
What do you say when words are not enough?
 
What can I say?
Now my words are not enough
