I'm not Marilyn, I don't like the night
And in the magazines I don't read my life
I'm a provincial, I didn't read Pascal
I have a normal life, it's almost original

A little Frenchwoman born in Provence
When she was fifteen, she came to Paris
Married the song, didn't change her name
And there she is, in front of you today

A little Frenchwoman born in Provence
Ran away far from her children's games
Was she right to leave her home
To be found in front of you today?

I'm not an idol who is loved and destroyed
I always live my turbulent years far from Paris
And without having a Rolls, I believe there's no better
When I see some kids playing around me

A little Frenchwoman born in Provence
When she was fifteen, she came to Paris
Married the song, didn't change her name
And there she is, in front of you today

A little Frenchwoman born in Provence
Ran away far from her children's games
Was she right to leave her home
To be found in front of you today?
