Ah... ah... ah...

I'm waiting for a thousand excuses from you, as always
You're a river of words, where I drown too
How great you are, but this talking from a talk show
What does it have to do with us?

I'm trying the only remedy that I've been using for a while
I close my ears to the story that I've heard before
It's the way you are, by now I should limit myself
Saying yes to you

Rivers of words
Rivers of words between us
Sometime they will take us away
I'll give you my heart
I'll give you my heart, if you want
If you can, speak to it now
Speak to it now
Ah...

You're shouting in a way that I don't understand anymore
I'm losing your respect, saying goodbye would be better
Like in a movie, the classic movie
Where she will do something foolish

Rivers of words
Rivers of words between us
Sometime they will take us away
I'll give you my heart
I'll give you my heart, if you want
If you can, speak to it now

I'd like to hold a picture
Feeling how it's going inside me
A silence from you with more complicity
I'd like...

Rivers of words
Rivers of words between us
Sometime they will take us away
I'll give you my heart
I'll give you my heart, if you want
If you can, speak to it now

Rivers of words
Rivers of words between us
Sometime they will take us away
I'll give you my heart
I'll give you my heart, if you want
If you can, speak to it now
Speak to it now
