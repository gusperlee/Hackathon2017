What should I call you, my joy, grieving joy?
An island in the sun is waiting for us
A wide door that opens in my soul
I sing to you and you shine, my sunrise

Motherland
My sweet homeland, lead to me
Your dreams, ah motherland
Into the depths of my heart

Show me
Your beauty, my Aphrodite
The wave rolls into my house
I bend my head in worship

You are a sequin in the day, the eye of the sun
A nightingale on slumber's pathway
A spring of honey and fairy tales
You are a longing that wants and tells the truth

Motherland
My sweet homeland, lead to me
Your dreams, ah motherland
Into the depths of my heart

Show me
Your beauty, my Aphrodite
The wave rolls into my house
I bend my head in worship

Motherland
My sweet homeland, lead to me
Your dreams, ah motherland
I bend my head in worship
