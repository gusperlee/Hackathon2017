The girls are pretty once spring is here
But the vows forget themselves once spring goes away
There in the prairie, I always await but in vain
A girl in organdy once spring returns
 
I think again about her eyes once spring is here
I see again our parting, once spring goes away
And her image hanging around the corner of my path
When the evenings become warm once spring returns
 
No, time can't do anything
No, it is not up to time
 
I believe I will find her once spring is here
I cease to dream about it once spring goes away
After many winters yet my heart remembers
As if it was yesterday once spring returns
 
No, time can't do anything
Oh no, it is not up to time
 
Sometimes I want to die once spring is here
I always believe to be healed once spring goes away
But I feel the sting of a pain that embraces me
Like an old wound once spring returns
 
Once spring returns, once spring returns
Once spring returns, once spring returns
