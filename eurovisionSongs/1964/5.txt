Tell me again, Mallory, the song you sang to me
Your summer song in the blue of the Irish sky
You were only sixteen years old, I still was a child
And the night that came took us for lovers
 
You, Mallory, you sang for me, the wind ruffled our hair
And I don't know anymore very well why we closed our eyes
Remember, Mallory, we've waited for the day
By dreaming, both of us, I really believe that it was love
 
Where is it, Mallory, the song you sang to me?
Your summer song in the blue of the Irish sky
The sun set, throwing gold in your eyes
We acted that we loved each other, but for you it was just a game
 
Oh Mallory, where is that song, that summer love song?
To which country did the wind go, the wind that carried it off?
I'll keep your song forever, Mallory
Because it was the song, the song of a first love
 
Lalala lalala... lalalalala lalala...
Because it was the song, the song of a first love
