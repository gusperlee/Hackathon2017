Where have they gone
Those who made me believe
The lovely story of the forbidden fruit?
 
So much time is spent in the vain expectation
Of unsteady embraces
So much time is lost
 
The heart, overflowing with so much tenderness
By my awkwardnesses kept its torment
 
On the street, tenderly, they took my hand
A private conversation, seriously, they said tomorrow
When I think of it today, however
I smile of the time
Of the past time, to believe in this story
 
Where have they gone
Those who made me believe
The lovely story of the forbidden fruit?
 
But that past time which seemed mad
So much nostalgia it will be worth to me
Because the girls then had the mystery
Of the first loves which are lost forever
 
Where have they gone
Those who made me believe
The lovely story of the forbidden fruit?
