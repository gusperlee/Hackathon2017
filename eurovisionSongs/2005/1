Far away in a lost world
I hear your voice calling for heaven
Cast away, caught in mem'ries
You must believe love will come through
 
I'll be your angel in your darkest night
I'll be your destiny, waiting by your side
I'll be the sunshine when you're feeling blue
I'm always here for you
 
Comes a day, heart on fire
When all your faith seems to be missing
Go your way and you'll find there
A land of hope, a land of dreams
 
I'll be your angel in your darkest night
I'll be your destiny, waiting by your side
I'll be the sunshine when you're feeling blue
I'm always here for you
 
And when you lose it all
And nothing seems right
Just keep holding on
To me
 
I'll be your angel in your darkest night
I'll be your destiny waiting by your side
I'll be the sunshine when you're feeling blue
I'm always here for you
