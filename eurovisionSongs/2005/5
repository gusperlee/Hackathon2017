Ta na na na... na na...
Na na na... na na...
 
I slowly walk into the night around
To see how dreams of people die
They gently fall from windows all around
And crash against the ground like glass
And I'm so sorry I'm so helpless in this angry world
If only I could change it for one day
 
The war is not over, everyone knows it
It's just a reason to make us believe
That someone's the loser, someone's the winner
To make us believe that's the way it should be
But I don't wanna believe
 
In the story they all tell this fairy tale has gone too far
I take a step and dare myself to be free
To see how beautiful we are, that everyone can be a star
If only we would start believe in dreams
Believe in who we are
 
The war is not over, everyone knows it
It's just a reason to make us believe
That someone's the loser, someone's the winner
To make us believe that's the way it should be
But I don't wanna believe
 
But I don't wanna believe
No, no, no, but I don't wanna believe
