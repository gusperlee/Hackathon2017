It's a jump up jungle, little like a break beat
Never seen that hit – Grandmamma beats the drum-a
Big mallet in the hand, high hat in the same beat
She's screaming like Hawkins, my old Big Mama

Grandmamma beat the drum-a like I never heard before
She's a slapping Miss Blackman, gimme some more
Check it, let's kick it, we wanna dance now
We are turning into hammers, ticking rhythm out

Grandmamma beats the drum (Hey)
Grandmamma beats it hard (Hey)
Grandmamma beats the drum with the mallet in the big house
Grandmamma beats the drum (Hey)
Grandmamma beats it hard (Hey)
Grandmamma with the mallet beats the drum in the big house

I love so much the drum making boom-boom
Now get your body moving, just follow the tune
It's a real magic – Big Mama play her drum-a
She's flying into trance like an Indian shaman

Who's the Beatles? Where from is Peter Pan?
Who's the gypsy Jimi Hendrix?
She don't care, that Mrs. L.
I smile, I cry when I see that crazy baba
Dizzy tempo, dizzy, let's go, my music mama

Grandmamma beats the drum (Hey)
Grandmamma beats it hard (Hey)
Grandmamma beats the drum with the mallet in the big house
Grandmamma beats the drum (Hey)
Grandmamma beats it hard (Hey)
Grandmamma with the mallet beats the drum in the big house

People in the place, feel your body shakes
Grandmamma beat the drum-a tapping out the breaks
Pop you up with that beat, get rid of rotten meat
You dig with your soul deep inside that rock 'n' roll

She's a drum machine, you know what I mean
She wanna play jumparale to make you spin
Drain a bottle of wine, no need to roll the leaves
By the end of that show, you will blow yourself to bits

Grandmamma beats the drum (Hey)
Grandmamma beats it hard (Hey)
Grandmamma beats the drum with the mallet in the big house
Grandmamma beats the drum (Hey)
Grandmamma beats it hard (Hey)
Grandmamma with the mallet beats the drum in the big house

Grandmamma beats the drum (Hey)
Grandmamma beats it hard (Hey)
Grandmamma beats the drum with the mallet in the big house
Grandmamma beats the drum (Hey)
Grandmamma beats it hard (Hey)
Grandmamma with the mallet beats the drum in the big house

You are real drum machine
You make me wanna dance, you are slapping queen
To get that state you drink juice from grapes
And I go deep into the music space

Grandmamma beats the drum
Grandmamma beats it hard
Grandmamma beats the drum with the mallet in the big house

Grandmamma beats the drum (Hey)
Grandmamma beats it hard (Hey)
Grandmamma beats the drum with the mallet in the big house
Grandmamma beats the drum (Hey)
Grandmamma beats it hard (Hey)
Grandmamma beats the drum with the mallet in the big house
