When I find you in my dreams
You always try to run away
It doesn't look it, but it seems
You still take my breath away
 
And when I try to ask you why
We couldn't give it one more try
I can't find you anywhere
You're not there
 
Let me try, let me try
I don't wanna say goodbye
I will find a way to make you stay
Just let me try
 
Looking back, I realise
We are learning from mistakes
I can see it in your eyes
I can feel your heartbeat breaks
 
But when I try to ask you why
We couldn't give it one more try
I can't find you anywhere
You are not there
 
Let me try, let me try
I don't wanna say goodbye
I will find a way to make you stay
Just let me try
 
Let me try, let me try
I don't wanna say goodbye
I will find a way to make you stay
Just let me try
 
Let me try, let me try
I don't wanna say goodbye
I will find a way to make you stay
Just let me try
 
Let me try
I will find a way to make you stay
Just let me try
