(Five, four, three, two, one, zero)

Boom-badaboom, boom boom
Boom-badaboom, boom boom

Before blowing everything up, boom boom
Leave me the time to love, badaboom
Still leave me my life, boom boom
At least a thousand and one nights, badaboom

Boom-badaboom, boom boom
Boom-badaboom, boom boom

Still leave me my life, boom boom
At least a thousand and one nights, badaboom
Leave me a thousand and one days, boom boom
Before counting backwards, badaboom

Boom-badaboom, boom boom
Boom-badaboom, boom boom
Let me live a little
(Eight, seven, six, five, four, three)
Before killing me
(Five, four, three, two, one, zero)

Boom-badaboom, boom boom
Boom-badaboom, boom boom

If my days are counted, boom boom
I don't only want to love, badaboom
If there exist other paradises, boom boom
I want to know them too, badaboom

Boom-badaboom, boom boom
Boum-badaboom, boom boom

If there exist other paradises, boom boom
I want to know them too, badaboom
When I have tried everything, boom boom
I'll leave without regret, badaboom

Boom-badaboom, boom boom
Boom-badaboom, boom boom
Boom-badaboom, boom boom
Boom-badaboom, boom boom
