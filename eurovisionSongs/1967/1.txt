I wonder if one day that you'll say that you care
If you say you love me madly, I'll gladly be there
Like a puppet on a string
 
Love is just like a merry-go-round
With all the fun of the fair
One day I'm feeling down on the ground
Then I'm up in the air
Are you leading me on?
Tomorrow, will you be gone?
 
I wonder if one day that you'll say that you care
If you say you love me madly, I'll gladly be there
Like a puppet on a string
 
I may win on the roundabout
Then I'll lose on the swings
In or out, there is never a doubt
Just who's pulling the strings
I'm all tied up in you
But where's it leading me to?
 
I wonder if one day that you'll say that you care
If you say you love me madly, I'll gladly be there
Like a puppet on a string
 
I wonder if one day that you'll say that you care
If you say you love me madly, I'll gladly be there
Like a puppet on a string
 
Like a puppet on a string
