The weather must be good there, in that beautiful country
From my own window, I see the rain falling

As you left, it was for being happy
All the best if you've been successful

I hate all those people with whom you live without me
I hate all those people who never speak to you about me

It's winter and I'll go through the wind
It's summer for you now

The weather must be good there, in that beautiful country
From my own window, I see the rain falling

Four seasons have already passed over us
And it rains on our house

I hate all those people with whom you live without me
I hate all those people who never speak to me about you

If you have to come back, don't wait too long
I can't hold the time

The weather must be good there, in that beautiful country
From my own window, I see life escaping

Life...
