\f0\fs24 \cf0 The weather must be good there, in that beautiful country\
From my own window, I see the rain falling\
\
As you left, it was for being happy\
All the best if you've been successful\
\
I hate all those people with whom you live without me\
I hate all those people who never speak to you about me\
\
It's winter and I'll go through the wind\
It's summer for you now\
\
The weather must be good there, in that beautiful country\
From my own window, I see the rain falling\
\
Four seasons have already passed over us\
And it rains on our house\
\
I hate all those people with whom you live without me\
I hate all those people who never speak to me about you\
\
If you have to come back, don't wait too long\
I can't hold the time\
\
The weather must be good there, in that beautiful country\
From my own window, I see life escaping\
\
Life...\
