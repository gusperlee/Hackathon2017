Seven degrees
I'm down on my knees
Waiting for the man to put me under his spell
 
Seven o' five
He walks into sight
Givin' me the eye, he lifts my spirits high
 
His passion burns and my luck takes a turn
I'm reborn and alive with his love to survive
 
Is it good? Is it bad?
Am I simply going mad?
Is it fiction or fact?
Am I really losing tact?
Is he magical, logical, natural? I wonder
He's got the makings of my seventh wonder
Ooh hoo... hoo... hoo...
 
Seventy three kisses for me
That whisper through the silence his feelings for me
Softly he dips my cherry-red lips
In the essence of a hope on which my love can float
 
His passion burns and my luck takes a turn
I'm reborn and alive with his love to survive
 
Is it good? Is it bad?
Am I simply going mad?
Is it fiction or fact?
Am I really losing tact?
Is he magical, logical, natural? I wonder
He's got the makings of my seventh wonder
 
On seven seas we sail on this dream
Turning it into virtual reality
Reality
 
Is it good? Is it bad?
Am I simply going mad?
Is it fiction or fact?
Am I really losing tact?
(Is he magical?) Magical
(Logical, natural? I wonder)
He's got the makings of my seventh wonder
 
Am I weak? Am I strong?
In his arms do I belong?
I could climb mountain high
For his love I'd learn to fly
Is he magical, logical, natural? I wonder
He's got the makings of my seventh wonder
(Is he fiction or a matter of fact?)
Seventh wonder
(Is he fiction or a matter of fact?)
Seventh wonder
