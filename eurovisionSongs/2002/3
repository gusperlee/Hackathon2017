I'd like to go away, but it's easier to say
That you know all the tricks that make... that make me stay
I'm ready to support this artful game you always play
'Cause you don't know the fee that you will later, later pay
 
Today you think you are the winner, today you think you are the king
You make me sweat in my emotions under your fly-away, fly-away wing
 
I wanna be the sunshine in your arms, I wanna be the light from shooting stars
I wanna be the queen in your sweet lies, I wanna be the love-spark in your eyes
I wanna be the sunshine in your arms, I wanna be the light from shooting stars
I wanna be the queen in your sweet lies, I wanna be the love-spark in your eyes
 
Ay ay ay ay ay ay...
 
I like a simple game, but it's just easier to say
That you own all that rules your crazy, crazy way
And even though you'll go on doing whatever... whatever you may
Just remember - it's me who find you when... when you was stray
 
Today you think you are the winner, today you think you are the king
You make me sweat in my emotions under your fly-away, fly-away wing
 
I wanna be the sunshine in your arms, I wanna be the light from shooting stars
I wanna be the queen in your sweet lies, I wanna be the love-spark in your eyes
I wanna be the sunshine in your arms, I wanna be the light from shooting stars
I wanna be the queen in your sweet lies, I wanna be the love-spark in your eyes
 
I wanna be the sunshine in your arms, I wanna be the light from shooting stars
I wanna be the queen in your sweet lies, I wanna be the love-spark in your eyes
I wanna be the sunshine in your arms, I wanna be the light from shooting stars
I wanna be the queen in your sweet lies, I wanna be the love-spark in your eyes
 
Ay ay ay ay ay ay...
