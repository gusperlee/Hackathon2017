We both made the same mistakes
And believe me, I know it
I've come to depend on you
In my eyes, can you see
That someone's still hurting me?
What can I say
That will make up for letting you down?
I just want you to know
 
So come back (Come back)
If you love me
How will I survive without you
(Without you)
 
Baby, come back (Come back)
If you need me
Maybe I was wrong
And I tried to pretend, but
Always in my heart
I know that I want you
Come back...
 
Tomorrow's another day, still I
Can't believe that I told you
And that was my big mistake
Every hour, every day
What can I do to make it through?
Oh, the days seem so long
I miss you so bad
And it's breaking my heart
 
So come back (Come back)
If you love me
(How will I survive)
How will I survive without you?
(Without you?)
Baby, come back (Come back)
If you need me
(How will I survive)
How will I survive without you?
(Without you, without you?)
Baby, come back (Come back)
If you need me
 
Maybe I was wrong
And I tried to pretend, but
Always in my heart
I know that I want you
Come back (Come back)
Before you break my heart
 
Oh, come back...
