Did somebody dare to tell you what's right
Which colours to wear, to laugh or cry?
You wanna be fair, and maybe you're right
Let's burn our fingers, stop the fight
Always drivin' through red lights, babe
Everybody stops but me
 
Just run away to the stars
Just run away till you're high enough
I will be waitin' above
I'll make it happen, I try so hard
 
How lucky you are, your statement is fine
Because what you think is what you find
(What you think is what you find)
Always drivin' through red lights, babe
Everybody stops but me
 
Just run away to the stars
Just run away till you're high enough
I will be waitin' above
I'll make it happen, I try so hard
 
Just run away to the stars
Just run away till you're high enough
I will be waitin' above
I'll make it happen, I try so hard
 
Did somebody say it's gonna be easy
'Til you get to where you do belong?
Your newly opened mind explains the reasons
Why you have to carry on
 
Just run away to the...
Just run away to the stars
Just run away till you're high enough
I will be waitin' above
I'll make it happen, I try so hard
 
Just run away to the stars
Just run away till you're high enough
I will be waitin' above
I'll make it happen, I try so hard
 
Oh yeah yeah...
Just run away to the stars
