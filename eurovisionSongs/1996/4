I admit it all to you
Everything is meaningless without you
And while the cold rain falls down onto the city
Who knows where you are?

Ayaya yayayaya... you are my love
These are merciless times
You're a wild river on my path
Yet I love you still

The sun travels to the sea, my heart is going crazy
Give me strength, oh divine love
The sun travels to the sea, my heart is going crazy
Give me strength, oh divine love

I live for us
The earth carries my voice
To the depths of your soul, for that's my home
Yet I love you still

Hey... the sun travels to the sea, my heart is going crazy
Give me strength, oh divine love
The sun travels to the sea, my heart is going crazy
Give me strength, (oh divine love)

Give me strength, oh divine love
Filled with pride and willpower
Dancing like whirls in a waterfall

Filled with pride and willpower
Dancing like whirls in a waterfall

Ooh...
