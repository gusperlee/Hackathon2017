You know when I am satisfied
Then I have the whole world in my hands
And I can hold the wind
My soul is in storm
When I can't kiss you

If in the moment, I'm hurt
I only want to think about you
Then I'm not asking more
Than your eyes can tell me

I'll make a necklace of amber for you
And I'll put my voice in it
To sing a song
When I'm far away
Don't worry about me

When I lose you of sight
I'll find you, because of your pearl necklace
The voice of waves and clouds
Calls me from far away

When I'm sad and crying
I wish you'd come to me
The necklace around your neck is wet
If you leave me, I'll take the necklace from you
And its colour will fade

You know when I am satisfied
Then I have the whole world in my hands
And I can hold the wind
My soul is in storm
When I can't kiss you

When I'm sad and crying
I wish that you could run to me
The necklace around your neck is wet
If you leave me, I'll take the necklace from you
And its colour will fade

If you leave me, I'll take the necklace from you
And its colour will fade
