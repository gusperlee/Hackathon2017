Day is turning to evening, is gone, soon forgotten
But what we gave remains, a seed will grow and sprout

Such is love's way when it strikes you and me
Only when we learn and understand, it will ripen and be ours

Though the days pass by, vanishing, becoming years
Love will always remain, for ever and eternity
For eternity

The river smoothly flows, through meadows, plains and woods
But on its way to reach its goal, it passes stony rapids

Though the days pass by, vanishing, becoming years
Love will always remain, for ever and eternity
For eternity

Though the days pass by, vanishing, becoming years
Love will always remain, for ever and eternity
For eternity

Love will always remain, for ever and eternity
For eternity
