The winter is lowering its veil and is tucking in the houses
The fire in the tavern warms us and the food and the jugs
There he dances with the wild one
They are dancing like whirls in a waterfall
Filled with pride and willpower
Dancing like whirls in a waterfall

But rumours are spreading among the cottages
While snowflakes are falling
The stars are sparkling against the ice like clear crystals
There he runs away with the wild one
They are rushing like whirls in a waterfall
Filled with pride and willpower
Rushing like whirls in a waterfall

(Wild... wild... wild...)

The carriage is disappearing in the night
And the snow becomes snowdrifts along the road
The sound of hoofs are still echoing in the mountains
Playing carefreely like a waterfall

The night is lowering its veil and erasing the traces
Wherever they are, they're strong like the stream in springtime
There he dances with the wild one
They are dancing like whirls in a waterfall
Filled with pride and willpower
Dancing like whirls in a waterfall

Filled with pride and willpower
Dancing like whirls in a waterfall

Ooh...
