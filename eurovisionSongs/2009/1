Always on my mind, always in my heart
 
I've been waiting for you night after night
Like a shadow, staying close to the light
Suddenly you stand beside me
And I see a million burning stars
 
You are always on my mind, always in my heart
And I can hear you call my name on a mountain high
Always on my mind, always in my dreams
I wanna hold you close to me, always, all the time
 
I believe I'm addicted to you
In your eyes I see dreams comin' true
Finally I have found you
And now I will never let you go, no
 
You are always on my mind, always in my heart
And I can hear you call my name on a mountain high
Always on my mind, always in my dreams
I wanna hold you close to me, always, all the time
 
Always on my mind, always in my heart
And I can hear you call my name on a mountain high
Always on my mind, always in my dreams
I wanna hold you close to me, always, all the time
 
Always on my mind, always in my heart
Always on my mind, always in my dreams
Always, all the time
