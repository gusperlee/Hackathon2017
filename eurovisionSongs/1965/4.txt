Tell her, that I send her my love
Tell her, that I'm feeling fine
Don't tell her about my tears
And how my heart still hurts
 
Tell her, that I send her my love
Tell her, that I'm happy
Don't tell her about my hope
That often lies to my heart
 
Say hello to her, when you see her
And when she begins to speak about me
Then tell her what you want
Only the truth you can't tell her, please don't, oh...
 
Tell her, that I send her my love
Tell her, that I'm feeling fine
She went away, away from me
And she knows, that nothing remains with me
In spite of that, tell her that I love her
 
She went away, away from me
And she knows that nothing remains with me
In spite of that, tell her that I love her
 
Oh... I love her
