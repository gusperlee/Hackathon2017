If you cry, my love, I cry with you
Because I'm part of you
Always smile, if you don't want...
Don't ever want to see me suffering
 
If you laugh, my love, I laugh with you
Because you're part of me
Always remember: what you do
You'll see it again in my face
 
You're never alone, even if you...
You are far away from me
Every moment, wherever you'll go
You'll find me next to you
 
If you cry, if you laugh, I'm with you
Because I'm part of you
Always remember: what you do
You'll see it again in my face
 
Always remember: what you do
You'll see it again in my face
