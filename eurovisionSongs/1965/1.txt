I'm a wax doll, a sawdust doll
My heart is engraved in my songs
Wax doll, sawdust doll
Am I better, am I worse than a fashion doll?
I see life through bright rosy-tinted glasses
Wax doll, sawdust doll
 
My records are a mirror
In which everyone can see me
I'm everywhere at once
Broken in a thousand pieces of voice
 
Around me, I hear the rag dolls laughing
Those who dance to my songs
Wax doll, sawdust doll
They give in to a yes, to a name
Love is not only in songs
Wax doll, sawdust doll
 
My records are mirrors
In which everyone can see me
I'm everywhere at once
Broken in thousand pieces of voice
 
Alone, sometimes I sigh
I say to myself: "What good"
"Singing about love this way for no reason"
"Without knowing anything of boys?"
I'm nothing but a wax doll, but a sawdust doll
Under the sun of my blond hair
Wax doll, sawdust doll
 
But one day I'll live my songs
Wax doll, sawdust doll
Without fearing the warmth of boys
Wax doll, sawdust doll
