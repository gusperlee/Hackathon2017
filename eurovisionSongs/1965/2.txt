I belong, I belong, I belong
 
Since half my life, my heart's been sleepin'
For all this time, my love's been keepin'
 
But now my heart has recovered
From past affairs that turned wrong
All my dreams are uncovered
I belong, I belong, I belong
 
At first, I thought - just one more lover
But then I found why he's like no other
 
And now my heart has recovered
From past affairs that turned wrong
All my dreams are uncovered
I belong, I belong, I belong
 
Too many hours slipped away
Too many loves came my way
But they only broke my heart in two
While it needed someone just like you
 
At last you came, and from now on
The two of us would be as one
 
Yes, now my heart has recovered
From past affairs that turned wrong
All my dreams are uncovered
I belong, I belong, I belong
 
I belong
