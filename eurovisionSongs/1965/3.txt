Never admit, never, never, never, never
Never admit that you love
Never admit, never, never, oh no, never
Never admit that you love her
 
If you want to be given everything you're waiting for
If you want the autumn to have the scent of springtime
Be the one who changes course and always remember
That you have to sow doubt to reap love
 
Never admit, never, never, never, never
Never admit that you love
Never admit, never, never, oh no, never
Never admit that you love her
 
If you keep defending your happiness in love
If you keep listening to the most tender confessions
Be the one who is loved for saying nothing
Who begins a poem but doesn't finish it
 
Never admit, never, never, never, never
Never admit that you love
Never admit, never, never, oh no, never
Never admit that you love her
 
Never admit, never, never, never, never
Never admit that you love her
