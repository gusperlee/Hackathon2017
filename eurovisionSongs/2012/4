In this world, love lives no more
Time no longer has time for us, no
Ho... no oh oh, oh oh
No oh oh oh... no oh oh oh...
Time no longer has time for us

My plane is landing
On the unlit runway of your soul
They elbow their way through today â€“
Those who couldn't live yesterday
But yesterdays have no importance
They were swallowed by the turbulent seas
Oh, tomorrows won't bring anything
But hopeless hope and insanity

Just let me cry... cry... cry...
For this is the best I can do now
For this is the best I can do now

Just let me cry... cry... cry...
For this is the best I can do now
For this is the best I can do now

Just let me cry... cry... cry...
For this is the best I can do now
For this is the best I can do now
I wish you all the best
This is my shipwreck

Just go, just go there
Fly, sing, give your heart to someone else
But know that goodbye isn't the end

My love is not a thing
That I don't know what to do with
I wish you all the best
This love is just my shipwreck
