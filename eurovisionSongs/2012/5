You, you are my best friend
You are my everything, so don't leave me now
You, you are the best of me
The reason that I believe, so don't leave me now
 
And I try to keep us alive
But you're cold, cold, cold
Now every second that my heart skips, it ends
 
But I still wanna keep us alive
But it's cold, cold, cold, cold when the music dies
It's all black and white and there's no sunrise
When the music dies
 
No you, you can't even look at me
Still not gonna speak to me
Whoa oh oh oh...
 
And I try to keep us alive
But you're cold, cold, cold
Now every second that my heart skips, it ends
 
But I try to keep us alive
But it's cold, cold, cold, cold
When the music dies (Cold, cold, cold)
It gets cold and there's no sunrise
 
So cold, now every second that my heart skips, it ends
 
I try to keep us alive
But you're cold, cold, so cold
Every second my heartbeat ends
 
Still I try to keep us alive
But you're cold, cold, cold
When the music dies
