Better luck next time
You tell me that so easily
I see that it's not working for us
And yet it could have

And if you go
Know that something of yours
Will stay here

Love is not a thing
That I could give back to you
Look, it's just me
I've always loved you

Love is not a thing
That I don't know what to do with
I wish you all the best
This love is just my shipwreck

Your love is not a thing
That I could give back to you
Look, it's just me
I've always loved you

My love is not a thing
That I don't know what to do with
I wish you all the best
This is my shipwreck

Just go, just go there
Fly, sing, give your heart to someone else
But know that goodbye isn't the end

My love is not a thing
That I don't know what to do with
I wish you all the best
This love is just my shipwreck
