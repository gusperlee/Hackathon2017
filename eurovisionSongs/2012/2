Listen to the horizon
Listen to how far it takes you
Listen to what the wind has to say
Listen

Watch as darkness approaches
Wait – the light remains within us
Listen to how your land breathes
Listen

Listen to what has fallen silent
Just listen to these simple moments
Listen – the heart too has a voice

The path has passed into shadow
I look and keep on looking
Silence has the power to resound
I wait for you here, halfway there
Listen to my voice calling you

Listen to what has fallen silent
Just listen to these simple moments
Listen – the heart too has a voice

Listen to me now
For this is the best I can do now
I wish you all the best
This is my shipwreck

Just go, just go there
Fly, sing, give your heart to someone else
But know that goodbye isn't the end

My love is not a thing
That I don't know what to do with
I wish you all the best
This love is just my shipwreck
