The days don't pass without you
The nights are again without you
Ah... where are you my love? With whom are you?
I couldn't dare to ask you, so listen

Is this the end of this crazy love?
Without asking that I love you
Without ending the pain, without ending the night
Without going onto the roads, I can find you

Is he my darling, has he got a name?
Without asking that I know you
Without meeting, without talking
Without smiling to your face, I love you

Ah... where are you my love? With whom are you?
I couldn't dare to ask you, so listen

Is this the end of this crazy love?
Without asking that I love you
Without ending the pain, without ending the night
Without going onto the roads, I can find you
