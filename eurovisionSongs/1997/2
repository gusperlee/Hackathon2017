I saw you at an airport
Ticket in your hand
I got a feeling in my heart
I didn't understand
 
Something in the way you were
Something foreign in your eyes
Made me wish that I could share
One moment of your life
 
Mysterious woman
I wonder, did you see
The kind of spell you put on me?
Mysterious woman
I wish I could find the key
To the kind of spell you put on me
 
The room was full of faces
But you stood out from the crowd
People going places
Far away beyond the clouds
Were you from the streets of Paris
Or the coast of Italy?
Or were you from as far away
As the gulf of Araby?
 
Mysterious woman
I wonder, did you see
The kind of spell you put on me?
Mysterious woman
I wish I could find the key
To the kind of spell you put on me
 
Did I imagine you smiled
Or were my thoughts going wild?
 
Suddenly you were going
The speaker called your plane
There was no way of knowing
If I'd ever see you again
 
But this brief, so brief encounter
Will always stay with me
I will always treasure
The bittersweet memory
 
Mysterious woman
I wonder, did you see
The kind of spell you put on me?
Mysterious woman
It'll always be a mystery
The kind of spell you put on me
