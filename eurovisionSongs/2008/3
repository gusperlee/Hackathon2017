From my Armenian soil
I came to bring
The wind of the mountains
The light of the sun

You wanna be with me
You think and dream of me
Come, let's go, move, let's go

Instead of watching me
You should be reaching me
Come, let's go, move, let's go

(Let's, let's, let's, let's go)

Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go...

Time is here tonight
You should make it right
To end our fight
Just hold me tight

Hold me tight
Hold me tight, let's go

You wanna be with me
You think and dream of me
Come, let's go, move, let's go

Instead of watching me
You should be reaching me
Come, let's go, move, let's go

(Let's, let's, let's, let's go)

Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go...

Time is here tonight
You should make it right
To end our fight
Just hold me tight

Let's go...
Let's go...

(Let's go, let's go, let's go...)

Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go...

Time is here tonight
You should make it right
To end our fight
Just hold me tight

(Let's, let's, let's, let's go)
