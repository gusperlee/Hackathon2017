Love can be hard sometimes
Yes, it can catch you off guard like bad crimes
Yes, it can make you depressed and angry
Make you say: "Why me, why won't anybody try me?"
 
You might be saying: "Ooh, I don't wanna be lonely"
"Ooh, I don't wanna be by myself"
"Ooh, don't wanna be lonely"
"Why ain't anybody lovin' me?"
 
But there's always someone out there who'll be there for you
There is always someone out there who'll care for you
There's always someone out there who'll be true, true, true
Hold on, hold on, be strong
 
Love can go away forever if you push it
And you have to remember: don't rush it
If it ain't right, it is wrong
And you'll be crying: "Why me, why won't anybody try me?"
 
You might be saying: "Ooh, I don't wanna be lonely"
"Ooh, I don't wanna be by myself"
"Ooh, don't wanna be lonely, oh no no"
"Why ain't anybody lovin' me?"
 
Now, but there's always someone out there who'll be there for you
And there's always someone out there who'll care for you
There's always someone out there who'll be true, true, true
Hold on, hold on, be strong
 
And yes, there's always someone out there who'll be there for you
And there's always someone out there who'll care for you
There's always someone out there who'll be true, true, true
Hold on, hold on, be strong
 
Hold on, hold on, be strong
My child, hold on, hold on, be strong
