You've been my superstar
But it's not what you are
You've been my super hero
Since I've lived in your shade
Every step that I made
Brought me nothing but zero
 
But I'm staying alive
And now I'm changin' my life
With a burning desire
No one knows who I am
But I don't give a damn
Gonna set you on fire
 
Shady lady – I'm gonna strike like thunder
Are you ready? I wanna make you wonder
Rollin' steady – I'm gonna make you shiver
My heart is burning
 
Shady lady – I'm gonna strike like thunder
Are you ready? I wanna make you wonder
Rollin' steady – I'm gonna make you shiver
My heart is burning now
 
Just take a look at me
Deep inside and you'll see
All I kept under cover
There is one thing I bet
You're about to regret
I'm no longer your lover
 
I've just turned one more page
I belong to the stage
Baby, don't call me baby
 
Shady lady – I'm gonna strike like thunder
Are you ready? I wanna make you wonder
Rollin' steady – I'm gonna make you shiver
My heart is burning now
 
(Shady lady)
(Shady lady)
 
I wanna light you up and leave you alone
I am a brand new star that you've never known
I wanna light you up and leave you alone
I am a brand new star that you've never known
 
(Shady lady)
(Are you ready?)
 
Shady lady – I'm gonna strike like thunder
Are you ready? I wanna make you wonder
Rollin' steady – I'm gonna make you shiver
My heart is burning now
