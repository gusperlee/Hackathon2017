Even when the thunder and storm begins
I'll be standing strong like a tree in the wind
Nothing's gonna move this mountain
Or change my direction
 
I'm falling off the sky
And I'm all alone
The courage that's inside's gonna break my fall
Nothing's gonna dim my light within
 
But if I keep going on
It will never be impossible
Not today
 
'Cause I've got something to believe in
As long as I'm breathing
There is not a limit to what I can dream
 
'Cause I've got something to believe in
Mission to keep climbing
Nothing else can stop me if I just believe
And I believe in me
 
Even when the world tries to pull me down
Tell me that I can't, try to turn me around
I won't let them put my fire out, without no
 
But if I keep going on
It will never be impossible
Not today
 
Yes, I've got something to believe in
As long as I'm breathing
There is not a limit to what I can dream
 
'Cause I've got something to believe in
Mission to keep climbing
Nothing else can stop me if I just believe
 
And I believe I can do it all
Open every door
Turn unthinkable to reality
You'll see, I can do it all and more
 
Believing, as long as I'm breathing
There is not a limit to what I can dream
Believing, mission to keep climbing
Nothing else can stop me if I just believe
And I believe in me
