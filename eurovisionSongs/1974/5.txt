I didn't really speak French
When we both got to know each other
From your side, you don't say a word of English
But you guessed in my eyes, and we were happy

All dreams are allowed, although I leave you tonight
Your heart changed so quickly that our dreams have ended

Bye bye, I love you, love you
It was the most beautiful summer in my life, I love you, darling
My hurt heart, I leave, letting behind me
So much sorrow, so many days, so much love with you

All dreams are allowed, I loved you, I trusted you
I waited for the existence of what you promised me
All dreams are allowed, you haven't been loyal
You made me cry for her, you lied to me too many times

Bye bye, I love you, love you
It was the most beautiful summer in my life, I love you, darling
My hurt heart, I leave, letting behind me
So much sorrow, so many days, so much love with you

Bye bye, I love you, love you
It was the most beautiful summer in my life, I love you, darling
My hurt heart, I leave, letting behind me
So much sorrow, so many days, so much love with you

But to share us, be sorry and love you like before
But to share us, be sorry and love each other like before
