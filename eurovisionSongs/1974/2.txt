I walked a little, following his steps
And who knows why I wasn't laughing anymore
The grass leaned upon my dress
It was as if I was saying goodbye
I can't read my thoughts anymore
But then the atmosphere cleared up
And I had to say yes to him

Yes, my mind said yes
Out of fear or out of love
I never asked myself about it
Yes, I softly said yes
To feel an emotion
That I've never had before
And when in his face
The whole sky cleared up
Yes, yes

I can't remember anymore what happened after that
Maybe I woke up or I fell asleep
And in my dreams, there were wide prairies
And your hands were holding mine
We ran and then, we ran and then
And then the atmosphere cleared up
And I said yes to you once again
Yes

Yes, I softly said yes
To feel an emotion
That I've never had before
And when in his face
The whole sky cleared up

Yes (I said yes to love)
(And I would say yes to you every night like then)
Yes, yes
