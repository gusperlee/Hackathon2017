The days and nights went by, but no one told me
They can be fun too, if you only see
There's such a lot of beauty you can live for
You only need someone to open up your eyes
And you will see things never seen before
 
I see a star, a brand new star
It's right there, twinklin' in your eyes
I see a face, a happy face
It's like the mirror of my mind
 
I see a star, a brand new star
It's right there, twinklin' in your eyes
I see a face, a happy face
It's like the mirror of my mind
 
You opened up my eyes for all the beauty
The beauty we're inhaling every day
It's been there all my life, so it's my duty
I won't lose sight of it, the fire that you lit
Will keep on burning till the end of time
 
I see a star, a brand new star
It's right there, twinklin' in your eyes
I see a face, a happy face
It's like the mirror of my mind
 
I see a star, a brand new star
It's right there, twinklin' in your eyes
 
Happiness now is being shared by two
I just started my life anew
 
I see a star, a brand new star
It's right there, twinklin' in your eyes
I see a face, a happy face
It's like the mirror of my mind
