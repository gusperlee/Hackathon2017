\f0\fs24 \cf0 I walked a little, following his steps\
And who knows why I wasn't laughing anymore\
The grass leaned upon my dress\
It was as if I was saying goodbye\
I can't read my thoughts anymore\
But then the atmosphere cleared up\
And I had to say yes to him\
\
Yes, my mind said yes\
Out of fear or out of love\
I never asked myself about it\
Yes, I softly said yes\
To feel an emotion\
That I've never had before\
And when in his face\
The whole sky cleared up\
Yes, yes\
\
I can't remember anymore what happened after that\
Maybe I woke up or I fell asleep\
And in my dreams, there were wide prairies\
And your hands were holding mine\
We ran and then, we ran and then\
And then the atmosphere cleared up\
And I said yes to you once again\
Yes\
\
Yes, I softly said yes\
To feel an emotion\
That I've never had before\
And when in his face\
The whole sky cleared up\
\
Yes (I said yes to love)\
(And I would say yes to you every night like then)\
Yes, yes}
