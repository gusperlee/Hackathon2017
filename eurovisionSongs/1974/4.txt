Long, long live love
Love is to care
Caring and sharing
Long, long live love
 
All the kids, like ten tin soldiers
In a row follow hand in hand
Sister Anna, carrying the banner
For the Sally Annie Band
 
Singing songs of praise and glory
We all learned to love their story
Good things are comin' to ya
Glory, glory, hallelujah
 
Long, long live love
As long as we live
Living for giving
Long, long live love
 
On a wet day, dry day, great to be alive day
Brother takes the stand
Cymbals ringing, everybody singing
With the Sally Annie Band
 
Just a band of happy people
Teachin', preachin' love is equal
When you feel the spirit move ya
Glory, glory, hallelujah
 
Long, long live love
Love is to care
Caring and sharing, long
Long live love, love, love, love, love
 
Oh... long, long live love
As long as we live
Living for giving
Long, long live love
