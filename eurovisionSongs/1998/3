Such a lovely night, when the stars are shining bright
And you're near, we're all alone, 'cause I long for you so much
I never felt this way, not before
You turn on my mind more and more
 
I think that I'm in love and you mean so much to me
I think I love you so, I'll never let you go
This must be love
Up there we seem to flow, I'm certain and now I know
For me, yes, you're just the one
The one that I love
 
Such a lovely sight, when the colours shine so bright
And you're near, we're all alone, and I feel so warm inside
I never felt this way all my life
You came like spring sunshine, gave me life
 
I think that I'm in love and you mean so much to me
I think I love you so, I'll never let you go
This must be love
Up there we seem to flow, I'm certain and now I know
For me, yes, you're just the one
The one that I love
 
For me, yes, you're just the one
The one that I love
