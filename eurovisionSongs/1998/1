There is a woman who is larger than life
There are senses that only she possesses
There is magic and there are hard days
And a stage that is all hers

To the angels Diva is an empire
On the stage Diva is hysteria
She is all a love song

Viva we shall cheer, viva Victoria, Aphrodite
Viva to the Diva, viva Victoria, Cleopatra

There are women â€“ tears of life
They will say a prayer with no words

To the angels Diva is an empire
On the stage Diva is hysteria
She is all a love song

Viva we shall cheer, viva Victoria, Aphrodite
Viva to the Diva, viva Victoria, Cleopatra
Viva we shall cheer, viva Victoria, Aphrodite
Viva to the Diva, viva Victoria, Cleopatra

Diva, Diva, Diva, Diva

Viva we shall cheer, viva Victoria, Aphrodite
Viva to the Diva, viva Victoria, Cleopatra
Viva we shall cheer, viva Victoria, Aphrodite
Viva to the Diva, viva Victoria, Diva
If you say yes, it'll be a proof of choice

What is it that you want?
You are the traveller

We are, you are, they are, they are
We are, you are the travellers
We have, you have, they have, they have
We have, you have the house, the house

We are, you are, they are, they are
We are, you are the travellers
We have, you have, they have, they have
We have, you have the house, the house
