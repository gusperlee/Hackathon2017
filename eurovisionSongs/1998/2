I see your picture in a frame
I see a face without a name
Riding alone on an empty train
Where are you?
 
I live in a house of broken hearts
Leaves are falling in the park
Every day is a question mark
Where are you?
 
I would drive through the rain (to find you)
Walk a desert plain (behind you)
You could unlock these chains (I'm tied to)
Where are you now?
 
Through the storm I call your name (to guide you)
Love could be the flame (beside you)
If you unlock these chains (I'm tied to)
Where are you now?
 
Lying in my room at night
Silhouettes are dressed in white
Waiting for the morning light
Where are you?
 
Each day you will live and learn
As the wheels of heaven turn
For you my candle burns
Where are you?
 
I would drive through the rain (to find you)
Walk a desert plain (behind you)
You could unlock these chains (I'm tied to)
Where are you now?
 
Through the storm I call your name (to guide you)
Love could be the flame (beside you)
If you unlock these chains (I'm tied to)
Where are you now?
 
(So near) so near
(So far) so far
Out there I can almost touch you
You're here in my mind all the time
Where are you now?
 
(I would drive through the rain) to find you
(Walk a desert plain behind you)
You could unlock these chains (I'm tied to)
Where are you now?
 
Through the storm (I call your name to guide you)
Love could be the flame (beside you)
If you unlock these chains (I'm tied to)
Where are you?
Where are you now?
 
(I would drive through the rain to find you)
(Walk a desert plain behind you)
If you unlock these chains (I'm tied to)
Where are you now?
 
Through the storm (I call your name to guide you)
Love could be the flame (beside you)
(If you unlock these chains)
