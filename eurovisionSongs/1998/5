The Netherlands were cool and chilly
Another day has passed by
Once more, the moon has come
Silently, like a dear guest
To abridge my mornings

For the sorrow leads me through the years
Steals the dream, till a new day dawns

May the dawn never rise
May I disappear, may I cease to exist
May I not wake up without you
May the dawn never rise
May I disappear, may I cease to exist
May I not wake up without you

Another day has passed by

May the dawn never rise
May I disappear, may I cease to exist
May I not wake up without you
May the dawn never rise
May I disappear, may I cease to exist
May I not wake up without you

May I not wake up without you
May the dawn never rise
May I disappear, may I cease to exist
May I not wake up without you
May I not wake up without you

Heaven and earth are opening
When you touch me
I never wanted to believe
But there's more
Between heaven and earth

(Heaven and earth are moving)
When you're in front of me
(For me it's proven)
Oh, that fate exists

Heaven and earth are opening
When you touch me
I never wanted to believe
But there's more

(Heaven and earth)
Oh hayah... huah...
(Heaven and earth)
Ahaha, ahaha, ahahahahuah...
(Heaven and earth)
Ah ah ah, ah... huah ah...
(Heaven and earth)
Ah...

(Heaven and earth are moving)
When you're in front of me
(For me it's proven)
Oh, that fate exists

(Heaven and earth are opening)
Heaven and earth
(When you touch me)
Hey...
I never wanted to believe
But there's more, oho...
Between heaven and earth
