The Netherlands were cool and chilly
And especially the weather
The wind, it never fell
My love life all the more

What I read in your eyes
Lightened my fire
It's quite often underrated
The force of nature

Heaven and earth are moving
When you're in front of me
For me it's proven
That fate exists

Heaven and earth are opening
When you touch me
I never wanted to believe
But there's more
Between heaven and earth

Black skies are breaking open
On the horizon
Now I'll warm myself
By the rays of the sun
(Rays of the sun)

I've tried love
It was never what it seemed
But I saw the future
When I looked into your eyes

Heaven and earth are moving
When you're in front of me
For me it's proven
That fate exists

Heaven and earth are opening
When you touch me
I never wanted to believe
But there's more
Between heaven and earth

(Heaven and earth are moving)
When you're in front of me
(For me it's proven)
Oh, that fate exists

Heaven and earth are opening
When you touch me
I never wanted to believe
But there's more

(Heaven and earth)
Oh hayah... huah...
(Heaven and earth)
Ahaha, ahaha, ahahahahuah...
(Heaven and earth)
Ah ah ah, ah... huah ah...
(Heaven and earth)
Ah...

(Heaven and earth are moving)
When you're in front of me
(For me it's proven)
Oh, that fate exists

(Heaven and earth are opening)
Heaven and earth
(When you touch me)
Hey...
I never wanted to believe
But there's more, oho...
Between heaven and earth
