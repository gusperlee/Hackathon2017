Don't work on a Sunday, don't sleep on a Monday
Just think of a fun day when your life is getting you down, yeah
To get through a heartache, just picture a spring day
And play in the bright daylight a while
So give it a chance - you won't regret it
 
'Cause you know today won't last forever, tomorrow has a brand new name
I'll give you all that I can offer, the rest is all up to you, yeah
 
You're all out of luck, if you wanna give up, you've got to let go of all your bad memories
Breakin' it up means bringing it down, you need to get right back on track
'Cause you're all out of luck, if you wanna give up, you've got to believe in yourself
You'll be fine 'cause you'll be mine, so just wake up before it's too late
And you're all out of love, you're all out of love
Hey yeah... hey yeah... oh yeah...
 
Don't work on a Sunday, don't sleep on a Monday
Tomorrow's a new day, all the time, just waiting for you, yeah
From dawn until midnight, or asleep in the moonlight
You'll always be all right just as long as you follow your heart, yeah
 
You're all out of luck, if you wanna give up, you've got to let go of all your bad memories
Breakin' it up means bringing it down, you need to get right back on track
'Cause you're all out of luck, if you wanna give up, you've got to believe in yourself
You'll be fine 'cause you'll be mine, so just wake up before it's too late
And you're all out of love, you're all out of love
(Hey yeah... hey yeah... oh yeah...)
You're all out of love
Hey yeah... hey yeah... oh yeah...
