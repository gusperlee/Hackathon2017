For your love got me crucified
And released me of all my sins
As God is my witness, I swear by my heart
That this woman knows, she belongs to you entirely

Mary Magdalene, Mary Magdalene
Ah... Mary Magdalene
Ah...

The night guided me around the world
I told her: "Stop!" ah... "I won't go any further"
As God is my witness, I swear by my heart
That this woman knows, she belongs to you entirely

Mary Magdalene, Mary Magdalene
Ah... Mary Magdalene
Ah...

As God is my witness, I swear by my heart
That this woman knows, she belongs to you entirely

Mary Magdalene, Mary Magdalene
Ah... Mary Magdalene
Ah...

I am what I am, all I have is my soul
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do

Die for you
Look into my eyes and see it's true
Really, I could never lie to you
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do

Cause I would die for you
