I believe in God and God's decree
And I believe that nothing is an illusion
Everything is so true, so real
I believe in it, I believe in it

No, nothing occured that didn't have to
There isn't a face that wasn't wrinkled
There isn't a rock that won't become ashes
No shoulder that won't feel fear

What is it that you want?
You are the traveller

We are, you are, they are, they are
We are, you are the travellers
We have, you have, they have, they have
We have, you have the house, the house

Arrival is a dream, cover of a book
But parting is a dream's evil sister
What are we, if not travellers without a place?
We'll never know where this road leads us

What are we
What are we, you and me
If not travellers without a place?

Tell me are you sorry, do you feel remorse
If you say yes, you'll be giving up on yourself
Tell me are you sorry, do you feel remorse
If you say yes, it'll be a proof of choice

What is it that you want?
You are the traveller

We are, you are, they are, they are
We are, you are the travellers
We have, you have, they have, they have
We have, you have the house, the house

We are, you are, they are, they are
We are, you are the travellers
We have, you have, they have, they have
We have, you have the house, the house
