Shadows dancin' slowly on my wall
Moonlight paintin' silver to the sound of heartbeats
Magical emotions take control
Knowin' we will meet before the night is over
 
Then I'm gonna make you mine, love you till the end of time
 
Take me to your heaven, hold on to a dream
Take me to your heaven when my nights are cold and lonely
Flyin' high together on a journey to the stars
Won't you take me to your heaven, to your heart?
 
I can feel your body next to mine
Reachin' for a kiss that keeps me warm and tender
Seven steps to heaven show the way
When I'm there, I give myself in sweet surrender
 
Then I'm gonna make you mine, love you till the end of time
 
Take me to your heaven, hold on to a dream
Take me to your heaven when my nights are cold and lonely
Flyin' high together on a journey to the stars
Won't you take me to your heaven, to your heart?
 
As dawn is breakin' there is so much more to say
So will you be my one and only when nights are lonely?
Hold on tight forever
 
Take me to your heaven, hold on to a dream
Take me to your heaven when my nights are cold and lonely
Flyin' high together on a journey to the stars
Won't you take me to your heaven, to your heart?
 
Oh... so won't you take me to your heaven, to your heart?
