Silently glowing, moonbeams are sowing silver, silver starry-eyed skies
Burning in fire, words of desire linger, linger, long in disguise
 
Diamond of night, burning so bright, guide me my silvery new sign
Finding my way as I pray, now I can say it is my time
 
Voices are calling, whilst stardust falling, reveries, reveries lighten his heart
Silently blazing, stars so amazing, heavenly, heavenly fire from a spark
 
Diamond of night, burning so bright, guide me my silvery new sign
Finding my way as I pray, now I can say it is my time
 
Diamond of night, burning so bright, guide me my silvery new sign
Finding my way as I pray, now I can say it is my time
 
Diamond of night, burning bright, now I can say it is my time
