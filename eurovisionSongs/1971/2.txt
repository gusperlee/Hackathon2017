\f0\fs24 \cf0 Only at the end of the road you'll see things clear\
The reason to live and causes of a thousand more things\
When you're looking back, when you're there, you'll understand\
\
Search for simple things and you'll find the truth\
The truth of that love, let go of the rest\
Just love won't die in time\
\
At the end of the road\
All the dreams that you have inside will come true\
If in some point of your road\
You have filled your life with love and truth\
\
At the end of the road\
You can find the good you hoped to feel\
Forget the past, because it won't come back\
Keep the love you have in you\
\
At the end of the road\
There I'll be awakening, to start living again\
If in some point of your road\
You have filled your life with love and truth\
\
At the end of the road\
You'll have inside the faith and the joy of living\
All your dreams will always come true\
In a new happy world\
\

In a new happy world\
In a new happy world\
\
All your dreams will always come true\
If you fill your life with love and peace\
If you fill your life with love and peace\
In a new happy world}
