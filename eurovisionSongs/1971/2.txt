Only at the end of the road you'll see things clear
The reason to live and causes of a thousand more things
When you're looking back, when you're there, you'll understand

Search for simple things and you'll find the truth
The truth of that love, let go of the rest
Just love won't die in time

At the end of the road
All the dreams that you have inside will come true
If in some point of your road
You have filled your life with love and truth

At the end of the road
You can find the good you hoped to feel
Forget the past, because it won't come back
Keep the love you have in you

At the end of the road
There I'll be awakening, to start living again
If in some point of your road
You have filled your life with love and truth

At the end of the road
You'll have inside the faith and the joy of living
All your dreams will always come true
In a new happy world

At the end of the road
You'll have inside the faith and the joy of living
All your dreams will always come true
In a new happy world
In a new happy world
In a new happy world

All your dreams will always come true
If you fill your life with love and peace
If you fill your life with love and peace
In a new happy world
