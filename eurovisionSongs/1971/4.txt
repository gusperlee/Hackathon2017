Stop - don't say you'll put me down
Love - don't go away
Drop my feet back on the ground
Open your arms, let me stay
 
Hold me like you know you should
Don't leave me on the shelf
Like a doll you throw away
So sad and lonely all by myself
 
I'm just your Jack-in-the-Box
You know whenever love knocks
I'm gonna bounce up and down on my spring
A toy used up when it stops
I'm just your Jack-in-the-Box
Because for your love I'd do anything
 
Who just keeps my heart around?
Loves to pull the strings?
You - and when it's upside down
Look at the way that it swings
 
I can't help the way I feel
It's you and no one else
Comes the tune, but all too soon
I'm just a doll put back on the shelf
 
I'm just your Jack-in-the-Box
You know whenever love knocks
I'm gonna bounce up and down on my spring
A toy used up when it stops
I'm just your Jack-in-the-Box
Because for your love I'd do anything
 
La la la la la la la...
La la la la la la la...
La la la la la la la la la la...
La la la la la la la...
La la la la la la la...
La la la la la la la la la la...
 
Hey, hear what I say
You'll find someday that I walked away from you
So say I've got to stay
And from today it's love that's gonna break through
 
I'm just your Jack-in-the-Box
You know whenever love knocks
I'm gonna bounce up and down on my spring
A toy used up when it stops
I'm just your Jack-in-the-Box
Because for your love I'd do anything
 
Hey hey...
