Hello, forgive me my love, tonight I'm writing the last letter to you
I teared up thousands of them because I will leave you, but don't know how to tell it
You said that the one that can tear us apart will never be born

Love is a moment, love is a moment
But life is a storm, stronger than us

And go, sadness, go, for her there is a thought and a tear
Goodbye, good luck, you'll see the wounds will heal
Who knows if there will be a flower for you under the snow

(La la la la la la... la la la la la la...)
(La la la la la la la la la la la la...)

One month has passed and I already give in to melancholy
My only friend is the train that brings me home
You said that the one that can tear us apart will never be born

Love is a moment, love is a moment
But life is a storm, stronger than us

And go, sadness, go, for her there is a thought and a tear
Goodbye, good luck, you'll see the wounds will heal
Who knows if there will be a flower for you under the snow

Who knows if there will be a flower for you under the snow
