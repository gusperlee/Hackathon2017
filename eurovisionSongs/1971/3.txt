Starlit nights and the air is like jasmine
Rivers as clear as crystal and forests lush green
Is this still possible, or is it already too late
For this dream to be fulfilled for everyone everywhere?

This world, this world is a gift which life gave us
It's yours, it's mine, it's beautiful to live on
And what will happen is up to you

Smoke from a thousand chimneys is lowering over city and country
Where yesterday children were, now oil covers the beach
In jumbo jets we fly towards tomorrow
What will tomorrow be like, senseless or full of sunshine?

This world, this world is a gift which life gave us
It's yours, it's mine, it's beautiful to live on
And what will happen is up to you

This world, this world is a gift which life gave us
It's yours, it's mine, it's beautiful to live on
And what will happen is up to you

And even if it is just a piece of dust floating in infinity
Only this star is our star, the others are too far away

This world, this world is a gift which life gave us
It's yours, it's mine, it's beautiful to live on
And what will happen is up to you

This world, this world is a gift which life gave us
It's yours, it's mine, it's beautiful to live on
And what will happen is up to you

Ooh... is up to you
Ooh... is up to you
