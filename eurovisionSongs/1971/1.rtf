\f0\fs24 \cf0 We all have a bench, a tree, a street\
Where we cherished our dreams\
We all have a bench, a tree, a street\
A childhood that has been too short\
\
One day or another we have to leave\
To build a future, a future\
And it's the unforgettable instant\
When we return our child clothes, child clothes\
\
Everyone goes, filled with hope\
On the road that they chose, that they chose\
To the richness or to the glory\
Yet what our life will be, our life\
\
We all have a bench, a tree, a street\
Where we cherished our dreams\
We all have a bench, a tree, a street\
A childhood that has been too short\
\
Everyone, in his corner of the horizon\
Only defends their ambitions, their ambitions\
But if we share nothing\
What will be left for us in common, in common?\
\
We all have a bench, a tree, a street\
Where we cherished our dreams\
We all have a bench, a tree, a street\
A childhood that has been too short\
