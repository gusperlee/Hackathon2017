\f0\fs24 \cf0 Starlit nights and the air is like jasmine\
Rivers as clear as crystal and forests lush green\
Is this still possible, or is it already too late\
For this dream to be fulfilled for everyone everywhere?\
\
This world, this world is a gift which life gave us\
It's yours, it's mine, it's beautiful to live on\
And what will happen is up to you\
\
Smoke from a thousand chimneys is lowering over city and country\
Where yesterday children were, now oil covers the beach\
In jumbo jets we fly towards tomorrow\
What will tomorrow be like, senseless or full of sunshine?\
\
This world, this world is a gift which life gave us\
It's yours, it's mine, it's beautiful to live on\
And what will happen is up to you\
\
This world, this world is a gift which life gave us\
It's yours, it's mine, it's beautiful to live on\
And what will happen is up to you\
\
And even if it is just a piece of dust floating in infinity\
Only this star is our star, the others are too far away\
\
This world, this world is a gift which life gave us\
It's yours, it's mine, it's beautiful to live on\
And what will happen is up to you\
\
This world, this world is a gift which life gave us\
It's yours, it's mine, it's beautiful to live on\
And what will happen is up to you\
\
Ooh... is up to you\
Ooh... is up to you}
