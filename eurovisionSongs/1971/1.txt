We all have a bench, a tree, a street
Where we cherished our dreams
We all have a bench, a tree, a street
A childhood that has been too short

One day or another we have to leave
To build a future, a future
And it's the unforgettable instant
When we return our child clothes, child clothes

Everyone goes, filled with hope
On the road that they chose, that they chose
To the richness or to the glory
Yet what our life will be, our life

We all have a bench, a tree, a street
Where we cherished our dreams
We all have a bench, a tree, a street
A childhood that has been too short

Everyone, in his corner of the horizon
Only defends their ambitions, their ambitions
But if we share nothing
What will be left for us in common, in common?

We all have a bench, a tree, a street
Where we cherished our dreams
We all have a bench, a tree, a street
A childhood that has been too short

Lalala lala...
Lala lala lala...
Lalala lalala lala...
