\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hello, forgive me my love, tonight I'm writing the last letter to you\
I teared up thousands of them because I will leave you, but don't know how to tell it\
You said that the one that can tear us apart will never be born\
\
Love is a moment, love is a moment\
But life is a storm, stronger than us\
\
And go, sadness, go, for her there is a thought and a tear\
Goodbye, good luck, you'll see the wounds will heal\
Who knows if there will be a flower for you under the snow\
\
(La la la la la la... la la la la la la...)\
(La la la la la la la la la la la la...)\
\
One month has passed and I already give in to melancholy\
My only friend is the train that brings me home\
You said that the one that can tear us apart will never be born\
\
Love is a moment, love is a moment\
But life is a storm, stronger than us\
\
And go, sadness, go, for her there is a thought and a tear\
Goodbye, good luck, you'll see the wounds will heal\
Who knows if there will be a flower for you under the snow\
