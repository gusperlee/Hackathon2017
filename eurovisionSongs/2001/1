I sat down and thought
Realised that you love me
Only you, only you
Everything else is a lie
Just your warm hug
Keeps me alive

Cause I would die for you
Look into my eyes and see it's true
Really, I could never lie to you
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do

Die for you
Look into my eyes and see it's true
Really, I could never lie to you
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do

I sat down and thought
Realised that you love me
Only you, only you

Cause I would die for you
Look into my eyes and see it's true
Really, I could never lie to you
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do

Die for you
Look into my eyes and see it's true
Really, I could never lie to you
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do

Cause I would die for you
