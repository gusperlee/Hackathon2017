Since we have to tell, since we have to talk about ourselves
Since your heart doesn't burn anymore like before
Even if love, I believe, isn't said anymore
But since we have to tell, then listen to me

But I only have my soul to talk to you about myself
Oh, only my soul, my soul and my voice
So fragile flames at my finger tips
Derisory arms to talk about myself

Even if you say that I'm part of you
That our history will follow us step by step
I know very well that love has its laws
If we are to save it, then listen to me

But I only have my soul to talk to you about myself
Oh, only my soul, my soul and my voice
And my body is on fire because of the sound of your voice
I'm only a woman who likes you silently

I'd rather be damned if I lose my faith
If I am condemned, I will answer my fate
I'll kneel down unarmed, life will take control
Cause I am what I am and all I have is my soul

I am what I am, all I have is my soul
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do

Die for you
Look into my eyes and see it's true
Really, I could never lie to you
Just to make you see that
No one else could ever love you like the way I do

Cause I would die for you
