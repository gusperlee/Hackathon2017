I wanna know what you feel inside
Is something wrong? Why did you leave last night?
Is it all just a game? – Oh... tell me why we can't be lovers
 
I do believe in the two of us
That you and me – we are the only ones
And we were meant to be true, so tell me why we can't be lovers
 
How could I be such a fool
I thought I already knew it all, but I know
I was totally wrong
 
Listen to your heartbeat – it will take you higher
Follow your emotions – I know you'll get stronger
Listen to your heartbeat – the feeling will guide you
Hold on to devotion – I know it's inside you
 
How will I know if you're fooling me?
Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to be
Like it's all just a game, and I just want us to be lovers
 
We had it all in our hands
Just like those all happy ends
I still don't know why, but we lost it somehow
 
Listen to your heartbeat – it will take you higher
Follow your emotions – I know you'll get stronger
Listen to your heartbeat – the feeling will guide you
Hold on to devotion – I know it's inside you
 
One more chance to make a try
Nothing left to do for you and I
 
Listen to your heartbeat – it will take you higher
Follow your emotions – I know you'll get stronger
Listen to your heartbeat – the feeling will guide you
Hold on to devotion – I know it's inside you
 
Listen to your heartbeat
