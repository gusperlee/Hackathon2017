All right - Hey hey...
Well, are you ready? - You bet
But are you ready? - Oh yeah
All right - You give it to them now
 
Well, every night's a Friday night - Aha... what night?
Ladies, this sure feels right - I guess this is party time
The two of us will sing again - Two of us together again
The heart is young and we know when - Young and handsome, they say
Come on, Dave
 
To kick the sadness out the door - To kick the sadness out the door
And roll the carpet from the floor - Haha... carpet from the floor, yeah
Let the spirit hit the roof - I hit the roof, I hit the roof
The two of us still know the moves
 
And not even time can take away
The starlight from us, no, it won't fade
Still we believe that we were made to laugh and sing
 
Come on, everybody, let's sing along
And feel the power of a song
Come on, everybody, let's feel the spark
That always stays within our hearts
Come on, everybody, and let it out
And live the moment, here and now
Come on, everybody, 'cause here's a chance
To feel so light, to laugh and dance
 
A little rollercoaster ride - He's goin' for a ride now
Right into the starry night - Around and around and around we go
And leave the windows open wide - Why nobody can't stay?
And let the music pour inside - Aha...
 
Not even time can take away
The starlight from us, no, it won't fade
Still we believe that we were made to laugh and sing
 
Come on, everybody, let's sing along
And feel the power of a song
Come on, everybody, let's feel the spark
That always stays within our hearts
Come on, everybody, and let it out
And live the moment, here and now
Come on, everybody, 'cause here's a chance
To feel so light, to laugh and dance
 
Look at us now here together again
We started out long time ago - We knew back then
The music within us could never, could never end
All right
 
Oh yeah... - Let's sing along
Y'all come on - Come on, everybody
Come on, come on - Na na na na yeah yeah...
Come on, come on - One more time, yeah
 
Come on, everybody, let's sing along
And feel the power of a song
Come on, everybody, let's feel the spark
That always stays within our hearts
Come on, everybody, and let it out
And live the moment, here and now
Come on, everybody, 'cause here's a chance
To feel so light, to laugh and dance
 
Come on, everybody, let's sing along
