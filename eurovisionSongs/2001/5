Oh... oh... mmm...
I'll never ever let you go
Mmm... mmm... mmm...
 
Each morning I wake up alone, for too long I've been on my own
You seem to fill my heart and mind, the greatest love that I could find
Love that I could find
 
I'll never ever let you go though you hurt my feelings
You bring back memories all the time
I'll never ever be the same since you left me lonely
So please come back to me again
 
These last days I've been down and blue, I wonder if you miss me too
I think about you all the time and keep on waitin' for a sign
Waitin' for a sign
 
I'll never ever let you go though you hurt my feelings
You bring back memories all the time
I'll never ever be the same since you left me lonely
So please come back to me again
 
I cry out your name, I'm sick and tired of this game
Oo... baby, kiss me, I think this love was meant to be
Oh yeah... oh... love was meant to be, yeah
 
I'll never ever let you go though you hurt my feelings
You bring back memories all the time
I'll never ever be the same since you left me lonely
So please come back to me again
 
Mmm... oh...
I'll never ever let you go
Mmm... oh... yeah
 
I'll never ever let you go though you hurt my feelings
You bring back memories all the time
I'll never ever be the same since you left me lonely
So please come back to me again
 
I'll never ever let you go
