Heavy clouds, no rain, and every move causes pain
Ready kiss, but no love, I feel I'm torn in half
Burning look, but no heat, it's not you really need
Baby, now it's happened with us
We are dancing on broken glass
Can't stand no more
 
Never, never let you go
You are the one I'm searching for
Flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone
Love's carving it in the stone
 
Never, never let you go
Return the days we had before
Soul of my soul, blood of my blood
Love's carving it in my heart
 
Gentle words, no aim, it seems we're playing a game
Easy smile, but no fun, sweet music for no one
Close embrace, but no more, cold champagne we forgot to pour
Baby, now it's happened with us
We are dancing on broken glass
Can't stand no more
 
Never, never let you go
You are the one I'm searching for
Flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone
Love's carving it in the stone
 
Never, never let you go
Return the days we had before
Soul of my soul, blood of my blood
Love's carving it in my heart
 
Love's carving it in my heart
Ooh... baby, now it's happened with us
We are dancing on broken glass
(Can't stand no more)
 
Never, never let you go
You are the one I'm searching for
Flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone
Love's carving it in the stone
 
Never, never let you go
Return the days we had before
Soul of my soul, blood of my blood
Love's carving it in my heart
 
Never, never let you go
You are the one I'm searching for
Flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone
Love's carving it in the stone
 
Never, never let you go
Return the days we had before
Soul of my soul, blood of my blood
Love's carving it in my heart
 
Love's carving it in my heart
