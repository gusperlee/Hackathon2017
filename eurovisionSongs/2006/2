Yeah

I'm keeping your smile on my mind every day
I'm feeling your touch on my face even while you're away
Like when was together in that dream that could've been so right, hey
Like when was together in that dream that could've been so right

I'll come back, I'll come back
I'll give my life to you
You'll come back, you'll come back
You'll be forever mine

I'll come back, I'll come back
I'll give my life to you
You'll come back, you'll come back
You'll be forever mine

I wonder why I should feel so empty these days
I wonder why I should fall now while you're away
We'll dance together in that dream that could've been so right, hey
We'll dance together in that dream that could've been so right

I'll come back, I'll come back
I'll give my life to you
You'll come back, you'll come back
You'll be forever mine

I'm keeping your smile in my mind
I'm feeling your touch on my face
I just really miss you and I wanna kiss you
And I wonder why, why I didn't know
And I wonder why I didn't know

I'll come back, I'll come back
I'll give my life to you
You'll come back, you'll come back
You'll be forever mine

I'll come back, I'll come back
I'll give my life to you
You'll come back, you'll come back
You'll be forever mine

Time is here tonight
You should make it right
To end our fight
Just hold me tight

Let's go...
Let's go...

(Let's go, let's go, let's go...)

Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go...

Time is here tonight
You should make it right
To end our fight
Just hold me tight

(Let's, let's, let's, let's go)
