Down a field, a scent of wind
And pain follows me like a shadow
Are you sighing after me somewhere?
Where are you hidden from me?

Place rosemary in your hair
And a flower from an old fountain
Layla, could you love another?

If they propose to you tomorrow
Know that I won't be there
Sorrows are easily forgiven
But only love never is

Could you love another?

Dove, my dove
Bring her tears instead of a song
I'm leaving, as if guilty
For loving who I'm not allowed

Dove, my dove
Bring her tears instead of a song
I'm leaving, as if guilty
For loving you who I'm not allowed

For loving you, Lejla
(Dove, my dove)
Tara-doo-dai doo-dara dara-doo-da...

Tara-doo-dai doo-dara dara-doo-da... (Hey...)
Tara-doo-dai doo-dara dara-doo-da... (Hey, hey...)
Tara-doo-dai doo-dara dara-doo-da... (Hey...)
Tara-doo-dai doo-dara dara-doo-da..
(Prayer, prayer)

And heaven knows, just as I do
How many times I've repeated this
Heaven knows, just as I do
That your name is my only prayer

That your name is my prayer

Time is here tonight
You should make it right
To end our fight
Just hold me tight

Let's go...
Let's go...

(Let's go, let's go, let's go...)

Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go...

Time is here tonight
You should make it right
To end our fight
Just hold me tight

(Let's, let's, let's, let's go)
