Never gonna run away, I'm not gonna hide
I know just what I feel inside
Oh... nothing's gonna make a change, forever with you
You're always by my side
You're always on my mind
 
Invincible – one love supreme
Unbreakable – one land of dreams
Two hearts unite – insatiable
This love tonight – invincible
 
Love is like a miracle invading your heart
And when it strikes, it hits you hard
Whoa... and when it's comin' over you, you won't let it go
I'm always on your side (Always on your side)
You're always on my mind
 
Invincible – one love supreme
Unbreakable – one land of dreams
Two hearts unite – insatiable
This love tonight – invincible
 
I'm always on your side (Always on your side)
You're always on my mind
 
(Invincible) Oh... invincible
Unbreakable – one land of dreams, a land of dreams
Two hearts unite – insatiable
This love tonight – invincible
 
This love tonight – invincible
