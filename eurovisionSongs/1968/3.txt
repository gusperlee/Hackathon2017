The source sings in the middle of the wood, and I wonder
If I should believe this legend of a girl they found there

She was blonde, she was gentle
She liked to rest
In the wood, lying down on the moss
Listening to the birds singing

One day she was going to town
Through the woods, that she passed by
She suddenly saw, motionless
Three men looking at her
Three men looking at her

The source sings in the middle of the wood, and I wonder
If I should believe this legend of a girl they found there

They were three, there, waiting for her
Three men-wolves, this lamb
Her flesh was much too tender
They had too much appetite

She didn't know how to defend
The fragile breath of her life
She fell down on the soft grass
Like a bird falls from the nest
Like a bird falls from the nest

The source sings in the middle of the wood, and I wonder
If I should believe this legend of a girl they found there

When they picked her up from the ground
Like a big cut flower
Her white dress and the light
She looked like a bride

When they picked her up from the ground
She looked like a big lily
Among the leaves, among the rocks
A pure source gushed out
A pure source gushed out

The source sings in the middle of the wood, and I wonder
If I should believe this legend of a girl they found there

If I should believe this legend of a girl they found there
