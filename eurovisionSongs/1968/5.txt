The day before yesterday I suddenly turned down the guys
When they invited me to a party
And then I spent a whole evening conversing
With your mother, being polite

It's beginning to look like love, darn it
The kind of thing you see in the movies, imagine that
I guess I'm suspicious, but the thought crops up
But by all means, I could be wrong

Last night I went with you and watched a tearjerker
Although I wanted to watch 'bang-bang'
And then I sat listening to a string quartet
Me, I only used to like 'twang-twang'

It's beginning to look like love, darn it
The kind of thing you read about in books, imagine that
I don't understand it, I guess I'm a little stupid
But by all means, I could be wrong

This morning I sang as I brushed my teeth
And then I began working like crazy
And then I called you about nothing at all
Just because I suddenly felt like it

It's beginning to look like love, darn it
The kind of thing that happens to others, imagine that
It all indicates, that I'm in love and all that
But by all means, I could be wrong

It's beginning to look like love, darn it
The kind of thing that happens to others, imagine that
It all indicates, that I'm in love and all that
But by all means, I could be wrong
I could be wrong
