\f0\fs24 \cf0 Congratulations and celebrations\
When I tell everyone that you're in love with me\
Congratulations and jubilations\
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be\
 \
Who would believe that I could be happy and contented?\
I used to think that happiness hadn't been invented\
But that was in the bad old days before I met you\
Or when I let you walk into my heart\
 \
Congratulations and celebrations\
When I tell everyone that you're in love with me\
Congratulations and jubilations\
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be\
 \
I was afraid that maybe you thought you were above me\
That I was only fooling myself to think you'd love me\
But then tonight you said you couldn't live without me\
That round about me, you wanted to stay\
 \
Congratulations and celebrations\
When I tell everyone that you're in love with me\
Congratulations and jubilations\
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be\
 \
Congratulations and jubilations\
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be\
 \
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be\
