Congratulations and celebrations
When I tell everyone that you're in love with me
Congratulations and jubilations
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be
 
Who would believe that I could be happy and contented?
I used to think that happiness hadn't been invented
But that was in the bad old days before I met you
Or when I let you walk into my heart
 
Congratulations and celebrations
When I tell everyone that you're in love with me
Congratulations and jubilations
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be
 
I was afraid that maybe you thought you were above me
That I was only fooling myself to think you'd love me
But then tonight you said you couldn't live without me
That round about me, you wanted to stay
 
Congratulations and celebrations
When I tell everyone that you're in love with me
Congratulations and jubilations
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be
 
Congratulations and jubilations
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be
 
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be
