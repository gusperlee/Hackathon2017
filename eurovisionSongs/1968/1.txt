\f0\fs24 \cf0 (La lalala lalala lalala...)\
\
I sing to the morning which sees my youth\
And to the sun that brings us new hope day by day\
Everything in life is like a song\
Which is sung when you were born and also on your farewell\
\
La lalala lalala lalala...\
La lalala lalala la...\
La lalala lalala lalala...\
La lalala lalala...\
\
I sing to my mother who gave me my life\
I sing to the earth which has seen me growing\
And I sing to the day when I felt love\
Walking through life I learned this song\
\
La lalala lalala lalala...\
La lalala lalala la...\
La lalala lalala lalala...\
La lalala lalala...}
