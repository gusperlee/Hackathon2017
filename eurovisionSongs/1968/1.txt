(La lalala lalala lalala...)

I sing to the morning which sees my youth
And to the sun that brings us new hope day by day
Everything in life is like a song
Which is sung when you were born and also on your farewell

La lalala lalala lalala...
La lalala lalala la...
La lalala lalala lalala...
La lalala lalala...

I sing to my mother who gave me my life
I sing to the earth which has seen me growing
And I sing to the day when I felt love
Walking through life I learned this song

La lalala lalala lalala...
La lalala lalala la...
La lalala lalala lalala...
La lalala lalala...
