One day, while I was out walking
I saw your face in the midst of a crowd
Here, I thought, is the chance of a lifetime
I thought you'd stepped from a cloud
 
Think of that wonderful meeting
Oh, the sun shone down on us from above
Why should I be out walking that day and get
The chance of a lifetime of love?
 
Show me the way you are feeling
Always tell me just what I should know
Oh, a guiding hand must have brought us together
But now that seems so long ago
 
You are the one I have dreamt of
Oh, I never thought my dreams would come true
All I want is the chance of a lifetime
The chance of a lifetime with you
 
Show me the way you are feeling
Always tell me just what I should know
Oh, a guiding hand must have brought us together
But now that seems so long ago
 
You are the one I have dreamt of
I never thought my dreams would come true
All I want is the chance of a lifetime
The chance of a lifetime with you
 
All I want is the chance of a lifetime
The chance of a lifetime with you
