\f0\fs24 \cf0 One day, while I was out walking\
I saw your face in the midst of a crowd\
Here, I thought, is the chance of a lifetime\
I thought you'd stepped from a cloud\
 \
Think of that wonderful meeting\
Oh, the sun shone down on us from above\
Why should I be out walking that day and get\
The chance of a lifetime of love?\
 \
Show me the way you are feeling\
Always tell me just what I should know\
Oh, a guiding hand must have brought us together\
But now that seems so long ago\
 \
You are the one I have dreamt of\
Oh, I never thought my dreams would come true\
All I want is the chance of a lifetime\
The chance of a lifetime with you\
 \
Show me the way you are feeling\
Always tell me just what I should know\
Oh, a guiding hand must have brought us together\
But now that seems so long ago\
 \
You are the one I have dreamt of\
I never thought my dreams would come true\
All I want is the chance of a lifetime\
The chance of a lifetime with you\
 \
All I want is the chance of a lifetime\
The chance of a lifetime with you}
