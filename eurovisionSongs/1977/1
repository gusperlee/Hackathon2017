Like a child with eyes full of light
That sees the birds passing by in the distance
Like the blue bird flying over the earth
See how beautiful the world... the world is

Beautiful is the boat, dancing on the waves
Wild of life, love and wind
Beautiful is the song, coming from the waves
Abandoned to the white sand

White is the innocent, the blood from the poet
Who invents love by singing
So that life gets dressed in feast
And so that night changes to day

Day from a life when dawn breaks
To wake up the town with heavy eyes
When mornings gather the dreams
To give us a world of love

Love, it's you; love, it's me
The bird, it's you; the child, it's me

I'm just a girl of the shade
That sees the evening star shining
You, my star that forms a circle
Come to light my dark sun

Dark are the misery, the men and the war
Which believe that they hold the time's reins
The country of love doesn't have a border
For the ones who have a child's heart

Like a child with eyes full of light
That sees the birds passing by in the distance
Like the blue bird flying over the earth
We will find this world of love

Love, it's you; love, it's me
The bird, it's you; the child, it's me

The bird, it's you; the child, it's me
The bird, it's you; the child, it's me
