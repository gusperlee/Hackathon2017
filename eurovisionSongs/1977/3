The sweetest thrill is knowing you're wanted
Never thought I'd feel it again
So long ago, I almost forgot it
It's coming back like an old refrain
 
It's nice to be in love again
That old familiar feeling when
You say hello and you know it's love
 
It's nice to be in love again
That old familiar feeling when
You meet your girl and the world stands still
Your heart is filled with sweet melody
It's nice to be in love again
 
The sweetest thrill, I couldn't believe it
I hadn't even a friend
This heart of mine was thinking of leaving
Until you came walking round that bend
 
It's nice to be in love again
That old familiar feeling when you say hello
And you know it's love
 
It's nice to be in love again
That old familiar feeling when
You meet your girl and the world stands still
Your heart is filled with sweet melody
It's nice to be in love again
 
It's nice to be in love again
That old familiar feeling when
You meet your girl and the world stands still
Your heart is filled with sweet melody
It's nice to be in love again
 
It's nice to be in love again
That old familiar feeling when you say hello
