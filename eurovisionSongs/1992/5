Doubts and uncertainties, often cause me troubles
Will you and I fly on the wings of love
Or will everything remain as they are?
The answers are in the air
But yet I hesitate

No or yes? Now or then? I will never decide
Awake or asleep, you're constantly on my mind
No or yes? Off or on? It's difficult to find the answer
Though I believe I'll find it with you

You'll spin me a web of adventure
If we ever become one
Still, it's impossible to foresee the end of the tale and the answers

No or yes? Now or then? I will never decide
Awake or asleep, you're constantly on my mind
No or yes? Off or on? It's difficult to find the answer
Though I believe I'll find it with you

My mind goes back and forth
I'm bewitched, yet still hesitant

No or...
No or yes? Now or then? I will never decide
Awake or asleep, you're constantly on my mind
No or yes? Off or on? It's difficult to find the answer
Though I believe I'll find it with you

No or yes? Now or then? I will never decide
Awake or asleep, you're constantly on my mind
No or yes? Off or on? It's difficult to find the answer
Still I expect to find it
Expect to find it
Expect to find it with you
With you

No or yes?
