Little child, your look - it pains me
It's an answer your eyes seek
Can't you see what shadow of a soul
I've come to be tired of the scene
 
Little child, come sit beside me
It's so much I have to say
Stay as free as high winds on the seas
No destiny bringin' lonely tears
 
Smile, live today, and leave the past behind
Live it up day by day, and surely you may find
That both sorrow and tomorrow
Aren't worth a thought or two
Look at me and teach me to live again
 
Little child, your look elates me
It's an answer your eyes give
Now, you see, I'm on the road again
I'm bringin' out what child there's in me
 
Smile, live today, and leave the past behind
Live it up day by day, and surely you may find
That both sorrow and tomorrow
Aren't worth a thought or two
Look at me and teach me to live again
Live again
 
Sing, live today, this moment can't endure
Oh... let us reach for the stars - we'll make it, I'm that sure
Be it sadness, be it gladness, we can start it all anew
Look at me, look at me, and the sun comes shining through
