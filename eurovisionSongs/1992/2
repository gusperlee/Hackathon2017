(One step out of time)
Ooh yeah...
 
Another week, another day
When I call you're miles away
In the arms of another
All my friends say I'm crazy
Night after night I'm waitin'
You say that I'm wrong
Then you tell me that I'm comin' on too strong
 
One step out of time
One reason to put this love on the line again
Can't believe that it's true
Now I'm one step out of time
 
(One step, one step out of time)
(One step, one step out of time)
 
When I sleep I dream of you
You're in my mind in everything I do
Well, I still don't feel it's over
I know what's right
I could be with you holdin' you tight
Now that you're gone
Won't you tell me where I've been goin' wrong?
 
One step out of time
One reason to put this love on the line again
Can't believe that it's true
Now I'm one step out of time
 
Don't walk away, just let your heart
Decide that love is gonna stay
I know it's right, just think about it
Girl, ooh... for a while
 
Another week, another day
When I call you're miles away
And I still don't feel that it's over
 
(One step out of time)
One reason to put this love on the line
Oh... again
Can't believe that it's true
Now I'm one step out of time
 
(One step, one step out of time)
(One step, one step out of time)
One step, one step out of time
One step out of time
