It's been a long time since we were together
I'm back in Ireland and I miss you more than ever
In early spring we parted and I've been here since then
But if I could only see you once again
 
Meet me in Paris on a Champs-Élysées night
We could be in Rome again, 'neath the Trevi fountain light
We should be together, and maybe we just might
If you could only meet me somewhere in Europe tonight
 
I remember Amsterdam as we sailed along the canal
And as the leaves began to fall, we were walking in old Bruxelles
In the Black Forest on a German summer's day
And the memories refuse to go away
 
Meet me in Paris on a Champs-Élysées night
We could be in Rome again, 'neath the Trevi fountain light
We should be together, and maybe we just might
If you could only meet me somewhere in Europe
 
Don't you remember those Adriatic days?
I miss your laughter and all your little ways
I can still see you in London, walking on Trafalgar Square
And drinking wine in Old Seville, how I wish that we were there
 
Meet me in Paris on a Champs-Élysées night
We could be in Rome again, 'neath the Trevi fountain light
We should be together, maybe we just might
If you could only meet me somewhere in Europe tonight
 
Meet me in Paris on a Champs-Élysées night
We could be in Rome again, 'neath the Trevi fountain light
We should be together, and maybe we just might
If you could only meet me somewhere in Europe tonight
 
Somewhere in Europe tonight
Somewhere in Europe
