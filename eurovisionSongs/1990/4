With you – I become as I should be
Completely wild, I match your rhythm, you seduce me
I go – by what the eye sees
When I want something I demand, I become dangerous

One more song, a real swing and here
Nobody tires, you must dance until the end
One more beat! Tones to play with
That which charms me and strikes my heart

With me – there's no question
When we meet each other, I conjure a brew
A lot of fun comes with you
So I somehow turn wild, I turn crazy

One more song, a real swing and here
Nobody tires, you must dance until the end
One more beat! Tones to play with
That which charms me and strikes my heart

In your arms, I am free, we'll go anywhere
Let's let the magic of life take all control

One more song, a real swing and here
Nobody tires, you must dance until the end
One more beat! The game is only about
Us continuing faster, and never hesitating

That we continue, faster now
Never hesitate, me and you, – with anything
