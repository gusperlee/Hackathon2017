Ladies and Gentlemen
It's showtime at the Apollo Theater
Everybody, the Hardest-Working Man in Show Business

The moon bewitched me and took me to you
Love poison that I drank happily
And although my chest burned and scorched my skin
For me, it tasted as sweet as honey

Your eyes, bandit, stole with lies
The blood and the life of my heart
Your absence in my nights causes sadness
Sighs and tears of dark passion

And now every time that you leave me
I feel the pain growing bigger and bigger

Your eyes, bandit, stole with lies
The blood and the life of my heart
Your absence in my nights causes sadness
Sighs and tears, and dark passion

So embrace me with hurricane fury
May the fire of your love be like a volcano
And then kiss me, trap me in your net
May your lips finally quench my thirst

Your eyes, bandit, stole with lies
The blood and the life of my heart
Your absence in my nights causes sadness
Sighs and tears, and dark passion

Your eyes, bandit, stole with lies
The blood and the life of my heart
Your absence in my nights causes sadness
Sighs and tears, and dark passion
