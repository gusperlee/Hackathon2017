Together, unite, unite, Europe

With you, so far and different
With you, a friend that I thougt I lost
You and I, having the same dream
Together, unite, unite, Europe

And for you, a woman without borders
With you, under the same flags
You and I, under the same sky
Together, unite, unite, Europe

We're more and more free
It's no longer a dream and you're no longer alone
We're higher and higher
Give me your hand, so we can fly
Europe is not far away
This is an Italian song for you
Together, unite, unite, Europe

For us, in heaven a thousand violins
For us, love without borders
You and I, having the same ideals, mmm...
Together, unite, unite, Europe

We're more and more free
It's no longer a dream and we're no longer alone
We're uniting more and more
Give me your hand and you'll see you're flying
Europe is not far away
This is an Italian song for you
Together, unite, unite, Europe

We're more and more free
(More and more free)
Our stars, one single flag
We're stronger and stronger
(Stronger and stronger)
Give me your hand and you'll see yourself flying
Europe is not far away
This is an Italian song for you
Together, unite, unite, Europe

Europe is not far away
This is an Italian song for you
Together, unite, unite, Europe
