When someone talks to me about skin colour
I have the blues which sends shivers down my spine
I feel as if I'm in a tale by Edgar Allan Poe
It's the never more, the blue funk

White and black
Dance, swing on the white and black blues
We, the blacks
We're a few millions, a dime a dozen
Paradisiacal
Africa, my love, I have you in my skin
White and black
What does colour matter? All equal

Do you hear the beats of the tom-toms?
They go right through your heart, pierce your soul
Like the arrow of a hunter, equator
A knife blade on which tears are sparkling

White and black
Dance, swing on the white and black blues
We, the blacks
We're a few millions, a dime a dozen
Along the river
Under the sun overshadowed by the swamps
Where it rains
On our loves, may the storm come

White and black
Dance, swing on the white and black blues
We, the blacks
We're a few millions, a dime a dozen
Oh, white and black
Dance, swing on the white and black blues
That's all right
Dance, swing on the white blues

And black
