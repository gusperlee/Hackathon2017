If there's a place in your heart for me
There's a room in my place for you
'Cause I've got love enough...
Yes, I've got love enough...
Love enough for two
 
It isn't every road that leads me home
It isn't every day I'm on my own
But when I'm feeling sad and all alone
I think of you, yes, I do
 
You've got a very special kind of style
There's something in your eyes each time you smile
So tell me you can stay for just a while
And love me too
 
If there's a place in your heart for me
There's a room in my place for you
'Cause I've got love enough...
Yes, I've got love enough for two
 
If there's a time in your life for me
I've got a lifetime to spend with you
'Cause I've got love enough...
Yes, I've got love enough...
Love enough for two
 
It isn't every day you meet someone
You wanna pin your wildest dreams upon
It's true you haven't known me very long
But I hope and pray that you'll stay
 
There's something in the way you touch my soul
It seemed that I was half, but now I'm whole
You've got me under your complete control
In every way
 
If there's a place in your heart for me
There's a room in my place for you
'Cause I've got love enough...
Yes, I've got love enough for two
 
If there's a...
If there's a time in your life for me
I've got a lifetime to spend with you
'Cause I've got love enough...
Yes, I've got love enough...
Love enough for two
 
Oh, I've got love enough...
Oh, I've got love enough...
Love enough for two
