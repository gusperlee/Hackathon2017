Very small, sometimes he took me by the hand
And happy, with small steps, I walked along the paths
To the city of a thousand lights, alongside my father
To the extraordinary and magic world of cinema

Peter Pan, he was the tallest
For all the little children
And Mickey was so cheerful when he sang in the meadows
Alice in Wonderland on Sunday afternoon
Was blonde, was beautiful
And the film never ended

Cinema, cinema, the whole world is crazy about you
Cinema, cinema, you are the king of the children
Your pictures and your lights
Bring their fantasies to life
Like a carrousel of dreams
Turning and turning until infinity

Fred Astaire made me crazy
When his feet clicked on the ground
Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton
And the world of Walt Disney
The universe of my childhood will never leave me

Cinema, cinema, the whole world is crazy about you
Cinema, cinema, you are the king of the children
Your pictures and your lights
Bring their fantasies to life
Like a carrousel of dreams
Turning and turning until infinity

Cinema, cinema, the whole world is crazy about you
Cinema, cinema, you are the king of the children
Your pictures and your lights
Bring their fantasies to life
Like a carrousel of dreams
Turning and turning until infinity
We give everything for you
(But often he's got stage fright)

And laugh and cry for you
(Theatre, theatre)
Yes, we give everything for you
