They put a mask on every evening
And they play the role they have to play
They have sold their hearts to the theatre
They're standing up there and those below look at them
They're kings, beggars, clowns in the footlight
But how it looks deep inside them, you can't see

Theatre, theatre, the curtain opens
Then the stage becomes the world
Theatre, theatre, it's like an intoxication
And it's only the moment that counts

Like a burning fever, like a piece of happiness
A long forgotten dream comes back to life
Theatre, theatre, hated and loved
Heaven and hell at the same time

And the clown has to laugh, even if he wants to cry
And the audience doesn't see that a tear is rolling down
And the hero has to be strong, and fight for the right
But often he's got stage fright

Everything is just like theatre, but it's also reality
Theatre, the gateway to fantasy
Theatre, theatre, the only one who stays true
Who loves you with passion

Theatre, theatre
(And the clown has to laugh)
Is life and dream
(Even if he wants to cry)
Beginning and ending at the same time
(And the audience doesn't see that a tear is rolling down)

Theatre, theatre
(And the hero has to be strong)
You give us the applause
(And fight for the right)
We give everything for you
(But often he's got stage fright)

And laugh and cry for you
(Theatre, theatre)
Yes, we give everything for you
