Wherever you are in the world
You think back to that moment
And you don't know where you know it from

But all of sudden you remember again
There was a superb atmosphere
And it's there time and again

In Amsterdam, Amsterdam
All kinds of things are going on
Amsterdam, Amsterdam
Exists for centuries already

Amsterdam, Amsterdam
The city where everything's possible
Amsterdam, Amsterdam
Everyone knows about it

Here you're really never alone
You find a part of everyone
In everything around you

Here, all people feel happy
And free in their comings and goings
With the feeling of belonging

In Amsterdam, Amsterdam
All kinds of things are going on
Amsterdam, Amsterdam
Exists for centuries already

In that city where the whole wide world greets you
You'll find everything you're looking for
Everywhere in plenty

Amsterdam, Amsterdam
All kinds of things are going on there
Amsterdam, Amsterdam
Exists for centuries already

Amsterdam, Amsterdam
The city where everything's possible
Amsterdam, Amsterdam
Everyone knows about it
