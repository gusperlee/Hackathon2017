I've been waitin' such a long time
Lookin' out for you, but you're not here
What's another year?
 
I've been wakin' such a long time
Reachin' out for you, but you aren't near
What's another year?
 
What's another year
For someone who's lost everything that he owns?
What's another year
For someone who's gettin' used to bein' alone?
 
I've been prayin' such a long time
It's the only way to hide the fear
What's another year?
 
What's another year
For someone who's lost everything that he owns?
What's another year
For someone who's gettin' used to bein' alone?
 
I've been cryin' such a long time
With such a lot of pain in every tear
What's another year
(For someone who is getting used to being alone?)
What's another year
(For someone who is getting used to being alone?)
What's another year
(For someone who is getting used to being alone?)
