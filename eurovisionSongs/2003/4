Man is the measure of all things
The-the animals of the world
I rather like them
But more than anything I like
The-the hares and the bears
The bears

Soon all birds will die
Soon all beetles will die
Only Adam is lying in bed
And reproduces with Eve

The hares live in the forest
The cats in the meadows
And the cockroaches
They live under the tiles

Little hares have short noses
And little cats have soft paws
And Mrs Holle likes the wool
Of the dromedary from Africa

Uh!

The-the difference between people
Between apes and primates
It-it's not much bigger
Than between noodles and pancake stripes
Pancake stripes

But whoever wants to know more
About animals, should study biology
Or connect to my homepage
To find it out yourself

Some animals have wings
And others have fins
Some live outdoors
And others in cans

Little hares have short noses
And little cats have soft paws
And Mrs Holle likes the wool
Of the dromedary from Africa

Little hares have short noses
