One moment out of time
Someone finds a secret waiting behind
Knowing there's an end to a glory
End to a story so good, so divine
 
Heart, listen to your beating
Never gonna stop unless there's a doubt
Never speak to someone that knows you
More than yourself and the ghost that you hide
 
'Cause I'm in love with a beautiful girl
She's the one from the magical world
And I hold her now, when the rain starts to fall
I'm not afraid to move on
 
Lay down with someone strange
Dare to be the same, as always in time
Slowly seek the end and its glory
Worry to see if it's gone deep inside
 
'Cause I'm in love with a beautiful girl
She's the one from the magical world
And I hold her now, when the rain starts to fall
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
I'm not afraid to move on
 
I'm alone when the ghosts start to haunt
I'm alone, but I know
 
I'm in love with a beautiful girl
She's the one from the magical world
And I hold her now, when the rain starts to fall
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid to move on
