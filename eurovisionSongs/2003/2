Hoohooh, hoohooh, hoohooh
Haha, haha
Give me your love
 
Oh, I can be the one you love forever
I can be the dream of your heart
Every single moment
Oh, I'm thinking of you
I wish you felt the same way that I do
 
Give me your love
Give me all of your love
I'm the one for you
And try to believe me
I just wanna be
There by your side
 
Give me your love
Give me all of your love
When the morning comes
I'm waiting tonight and it feels so right
Give me your love
 
You can turn the winter into summer
Oh, yeah
You can be my wonder every day
Mmm, hoh...
Every time I see you, I just wanna hold you
I wish you felt the same way that I do
 
Give me your love
Give me all of your love
I'm the one for you
And try to believe me
I just wanna be
There by your side
 
Give me your love
Give me all of your love
When the morning comes
I've waited tonight and it feels so right
Give me your love
 
Sometimes I think that you're an angel
And it's plain to see that you can rescue me
Rescue me
 
Give me your love
Give me all of your love
I'm the one for you
And try to believe me
I just wanna be
There by your side
 
Give me your love
Give me all of your love
When the morning comes
I've waited tonight and it feels so right
Give me your love
