To dance from afar is not dancing
It's like dancing alone
You're dancing in your volcano
And two meters from you
I'm dancing on the pole

Let's try only once
To dance closely as with fire
Embracing the beat
Without ever separating
Your body from my body

To dance closely is dancing
Like the sea dances with the dolphins
Heart to heart in just one ballroom
Two dancers

Both embracing each other
Caressing each other
Feeling each other's skin
Our ballad is going to be played
Let's try
Try the art of flying

To dance closely is dancing
To dance closely is dancing
Is dancing
