I have never stopped believing
That after every night waits the dawn
Even though I can't understand
There's time for laughter when I start all over again

I can smell the scent from a quiet ocean
Suddenly I'm in the middle of a vivid hurricane

I am captured by a stormwind, stuck on you
Nothing can stop me, when it's blowing in my heart
Captured by a stormwind night and day
Only you and I are here, and the light that heaven left behind

It is time to move on
For the moments that have passed, never come back
Travelling on an open sea
Where everything is like new in the future you give

I'm leaving my safe harbour without missing it
Free, but still tied to open arms

I am captured by a stormwind, stuck on you
Nothing can stop me, when it's blowing in my heart
Captured by a stormwind night and day
Only you and I are here, and the light that heaven left behind

We are walking together, united by the bonds of love
My longing is awakened, when you smile and give me your hand

I am captured by a stormwind
Captured by a stormwind, (stuck on you)
Nothing can stop me, when it's blowing in my heart
Captured by a stormwind night and day
Only you and I are here, and the light that heaven left behind

(Captured by a stormwind)
I am captured by a stormwind
