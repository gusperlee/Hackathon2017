It's the last one who spoke who is right
In your house
It's the one who gave me a name who is right
In any case
Girl or boy, all those sayings are lessons
Don't say no
The world is neither good nor bad, you don't turn round
It's without reason

Huah huah... huah huah...
Hiah hiah... hiah hiah hiah...
Huah... hiah...

Tell me for what country you speak louder
In my house
Don't scream like a violin without music score
It's a lesson
The truth is hiding its face like a silence
That says a lot
It's the strongest one who spoke who is right
In any case

Huah huah... huah huah...
Hiah hiah... hiah hiah hiah...
Huah... hiah...

It's the last one who spoke who is right
In your house
It's the last one who spoke who is right
In any case

All the seasons do and undo even passions
What a derision
It's the last one who spoke who is right
Without any condition
Like this or like that
Here or over there

Huah huah... huah huah...
Hiah hiah... hiah hiah hiah...
Huah... hiah...

Hiah hiah... hiah hiah hiah...
Huah...
