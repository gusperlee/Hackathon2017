I want to dream a little tonight
To stop reality with four notes
Then, joy comes back into my mind
If there's a song of mine

It once again shows what is inside of me
In my smiles and your complicity
Then give a kick to my sadness
It's now that you leave

Take me away with you, don't ever leave me
I don't want to lose you, hold me tightly because
There's a song that will speak to you about me
I'll entrust it all my love for you

Then making out, sitting in a bar
With my notes and a dream inside of me
No, it doesn't help to stop reality
Close your eyes and go

Take me away with you, don't ever leave me
I don't want to lose you, hold me tightly because
There's a song that will speak to you about me
I'll entrust it all my love for you

A song that sings and lives for you
