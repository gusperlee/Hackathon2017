Here is my home, here I was born
On the plain by the sea
Here are the friends I grew up with
And I have no other place in the world
I have no other place in the world

Here is my home, here I would play
In the lowlands by the mountainside
Here I drank water from the well
And I planted grass in the desert
And I planted grass in the desert

Here I was born, here my children were born
Here I built my home with my own two hands
Here you are also with me and here are all of my thousand friends
And after two thousand years, an end to my wandering

Here I played all my songs
And I walked on a nightly journey
Here in my youth I defended
My own God's little acre
My own God's little acre

Here I was born, here my children were born
Here I built my home with my own two hands
Here you are also with me and here are all off my thousand friends
And after two thousand years, an end to my wandering

Here
Here I set my table
A piece of bread, a fresh flower
I opened a door to the neighbours
And we'll say "Ahalan" to whoever comes
("Ahalan")
And we'll say "Ahalan" to whoever comes

Here I was born, here my children were born
Here I built my home with my own two hands
Here you are also with me and here are all of my thousand friends
And after two thousand years, an end to my wandering

Here you are also with me and here are all of my thousand friends
And after two thousand years
After two thousand years

Here I was born, here my children were born
Here I built my home with my own two hands
Here you are also with me and here are all of my thousand friends
And after two thousand years an end to my wandering

Here you are also with me and here are all of my thousand friends
And after two thousand years
An end, an end to my wandering
