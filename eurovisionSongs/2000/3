I don't wish I could turn back time, I can move the mountains higher than high
Don't look back, hold on to your spirit, keep moving every minute
 
I know it seems a little premature to live for the moment, I'm just a girl
Don't look back, hold on to your spirit, keep moving every minute
 
What you give is what you get - there ain't no regrets
 
If you give me wings and reason why then I'll be an angel in your sky
Because I'm seventeen only once in a lifetime
Read my mind
 
I'm ready, why are you standing still? Are you coming with me? - I know you will
We can search the world together, come on, baby, now or never
 
What you give is what you get - there ain't no regrets
 
If you give me wings and reason why then I'll be an angel in your sky
Because I'm seventeen only once in a lifetime
Read my mind
 
If you give me wings and reason why then I'll be an angel in your sky
Because I'm seventeen only once in a lifetime
Read my mind
 
I believe there's a better place always somewhere else instead
I believe the grass is greener if I chase the magic no one else can find
(The magic no one else can find)
 
If you give me wings and reason why then I'll be an angel in your sky
Because I'm seventeen only once in a lifetime
Read my mind
