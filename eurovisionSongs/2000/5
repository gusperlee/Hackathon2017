Sitting alone, here in my room
Staring at your picture from midnight till noon
Counting the hours, counting the days
You know that I'll miss you in a million ways
 
Now I wait in the cold and this is getting old
No more stories, no more lies, take me off this ride
When you see me in the hall, I'll look at the wall
By my actions you should know – I'm going solo
Going solo
 
My friends try to tell me, I didn't want to listen
'Cause I'm the kind of person gotta find out on my own
I gave you my heart, you tore it apart
But I'm coming back strong, I knew it was wrong
 
Now I wait in the cold and this is getting old
No more stories, no more lies, take me off this ride
When you see me in the hall, I'll look at the wall
By my actions you should know
 
Now I wait in the cold and this is getting old
No more stories, no more lies, take me off this ride
When you see me in the hall, I'll look at the wall
By my actions you should know – I'm going solo
Going solo
 
Now I wait...
Wait in the cold and this is getting old
No more stories, no more lies, take me off this ride
When you see me in the hall, I'll look at the wall
By my actions you should know
 
Now I wait in the cold and this is getting old
No more stories, no more lies, take me off this ride
When you see me in the hall, I'll look at the wall
By my actions you should know – I'm going solo
