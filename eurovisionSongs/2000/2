My friends gonna call me: "Hey dreamer, the stars you are watching are so far"
Tonight, I know, I will get there by plane or by bus - right to my star
Pretend there are things you just don't know in spite someone's told you are so cute
You have to ask and I will show the snow in the summer or so, so
 
If my star would fall or disappear at all
I will follow my star till the end of my days
And my heart's gonna lead me through so many ways
And if you're gonna join me, I'll be your guide
Baby, never say never, be my runaway-bride
 
My friends gonna tell me: "Just calm down, the clouds you are walking are so high"
This is my chance, and I'll invite all the dreamers and lovers to fly, fly
I'm back from the future, life goes on, but still, I remember my promise
You have to ask and I will show the snow in the summer or so, so
 
If my star would fall or disappear at all
I will follow my star till the end of my days
And my heart's gonna lead me through so many ways
And if you're gonna join me, I'll be your guide
Baby, never say never, be my runaway-bride, yeah
 
My runaway-bride, hey hey hey... hey yeah...
 
If my star would fall or disappear at all
I will follow my star till the end of my days
And my heart's gonna lead me through so many ways
And if you're gonna join me, I'll be your guide
Baby, never say never, be my runaway-bride
 
Ah... hey... my runaway...
