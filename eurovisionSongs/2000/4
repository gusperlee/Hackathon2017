Nature's child lays beside a mother's broken heart
We stand denied the power and glory
Bitterness can't feed the hungry, hate just leaves us cold
It's time to change it
 
I lit a candle in a dream I thought I heard
Liberated voices crying freedom
Open hearts, open doors in truth and honesty
Let wisdom be the guiding light
 
Celebrate the new millennium of love
Where our footprints leave a harvest for the children
Somewhere on our journey lies a world beyond compare
I believe we all have the answer
 
A cloud can hide a mountain
And a face can hide the pain
Search until you find the answer
There is no reason
Who can understand man's inhumanity to man?
 
Celebrate the new millennium of love
Where our footprints leave a harvest for the children
Somewhere on our journey lies a world beyond compare
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe in you
 
(Celebrate the new millennium of love)
Let our footprints leave a harvest for the children
Somewhere on our journey lies a world beyond compare
I believe we all have the answer
I believe we all have the answer
