In the summer nights, when the moon shines bright, feeling love forever
And the heat is on when the daylight's gone, still happy together
There's just one more thing I'd like to add - she's the greatest love I've ever had
 
Fly on the wings of love, fly, baby, fly
Reaching the stars above, touching the sky
 
And as time goes by, there's a lot to try, and I'm feelin' lucky
In the softest sand, smiling hand in hand, love is all around me
There's just one more thing I'd like to add - she's the greatest love I've ever had
 
Fly on the wings of love, fly, baby, fly
Reaching the stars above, touching the sky
 
If you just fly, (fly, baby, fly)
Fly on the wings of love, (on the wings of love)
Reaching the stars above, (fly, baby, fly,) touching the sky
 
Fly on the wings of love, fly, baby, fly
Reaching the stars above, touching the sky
 
Fly on the wings of love, (fly, baby, fly)
Fly, baby, fly (on the wings of love)
Reaching the stars above, (fly, baby, fly,) touching the sky
If you just fly on wings of love
