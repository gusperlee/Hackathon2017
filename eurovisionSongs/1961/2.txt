Goodbye (goodbye)
Farewell (farewell)
I'm not sure what to do
So long (so long)
Au revoir (au revoir)
It's hard, but I'll pull through
 
Are you sure you won't be sorry?
Comes tomorrow, you won't want me
Back again to hold you tightly?
 
Now are you sure
It's not your foolish heart?
That you won't grieve
If we're to be apart?
 
You will see, as time goes by
We'll grow lonely - you and I
Dreaming of each other and we'll cry
 
Goodbye (goodbye)
Farewell (farewell)
I'm not sure what to do
So long (so long)
Au revoir (au revoir)
It's hard, but I'll pull through
 
Are you sure you won't be sorry?
Comes tomorrow, you won't want me
Back again to hold you tightly?
 
Just stop and think
It's your decision now
For you're the one
Who went and broke the vow
 
You'll be sorry, wait and see
Spend your life in misery
Wishing that you had returned to me
 
Goodbye (goodbye)
Farewell (farewell)
What is there to live for?
Before you go
Just think now, are you sure?
 
Are you sure you won't be sorry?
Comes tomorrow, you won't want me
Back again to hold you tightly in my arms?
