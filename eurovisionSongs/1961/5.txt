You are so wonderful, Angelique
What are the stars compared to your pretty eyes?
Your voice sounds like the sweetest music
And your soul is made of dream and romance
 
If I wore Shakespeare's poetry hat
I'd be writing poems to you day and night
And if I wore Caruso's cape
Then I'd sing and sing for you
 
And I'd paint you lovely and bashful
If I could paint as Rembrandt could
And I'd worship you on a violin
If I could play like Menuhin
 
But all the Muses said no
I don't master singing and string playing
Just let me dream a little of you, Angelique
So I feel as just a single little pawn
In the mosaic of you life
 
Around the world there are wonderful girls
Some have the soft, and some have the fiery look
But if I searched in all of the most wonderful countries
I'd never find anyone so beautiful as you, Angelique
 
If I wore Shakespeare's poetry hat
I'd be writing poems to you day and night
And if I wore Caruso's cape
Then I'd sing and sing for you
 
And I'd paint you lovely and bashful
If I could paint as Rembrandt could
And I'd worship you on a violin
If I could play like Menuhin
 
But all the Muses said no
I don't master singing and string playing
Just let me dream a little of you, Angelique
So I feel as just a single little pawn
In the mosaic of you life
 
Angelique, you, my wonderful Angelique
My Angelique
