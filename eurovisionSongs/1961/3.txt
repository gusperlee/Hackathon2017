Tomorrow we'll have
Gardens for picking bouquets of dreams
Tomorrow we'll have
A morning for smiling to the rising sun
Tomorrow we could
In the same house, prepare silently
The cradle of luck that we'll have tomorrow
 
You complain about living in a house without lights
You don't have a Sunday and I don't have a ceiling
When I leave in the morning my outskirt without lights
In another district, you go back to home
 
Tomorrow we'll have
Less time for killing, less lonely nights
Tomorrow we'll go
To the woods for lying down or jumping the rivers
Tomorrow we'll have
Friends who will come without being illuminated by the moon
And onto the luck that we'll have tomorrow
 
You tell me that time slows down every day
You tell me that tomorrow is too late for coming
We'll never live in Spanish castles
But, my darling, do we have to refuse to build one?
 
Tomorrow we'll have
Less time for killing, less lonely nights
Tomorrow we'll go
To the woods for lying down or jumping the rivers
Tomorrow we'll have
Friends who will come without being illuminated by the moon
And onto the luck that we'll have tomorrow
 
That we'll have tomorrow
That we'll have tomorrow
