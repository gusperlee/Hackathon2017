Ding and dong and ding and dong, listen in the light air to
Just four notes going for a walk
Ding and dong and ding and dong running by mounts and valleys
They delight the amazed nature with songs
 
Springtime, springtime, April rings
The marmot wakes up at the first sun
Springtime, springtime, the bees buzz
While all the leafbuds open their homes
 
The hedgehog sharpens its not-so-nasty quills
The finch plays the flute, flying happily
Springtime, springtime, the wind swirls
Sowing butterflies on every bush
 
Ding and dong and ding and dong in the shadow of the forest
The spider pulls the bells of the lily-of-the-valley with the end of his thread
Ding and dong and ding and dong, all dancing like a fool
The winding stream plays with the pebbles
 
Springtime, springtime, April rings
Mr Badger who slept, goes out to take some fresh air
Springtime, springtime, the touchy look
The snail comes to get drunk of a dewdrop
 
And the ant worries, she has run out of provisions
But the cicada is getting ready for making a song
Springtime, springtime, on the freezing water
A big leaf of water lily pampers tadpoles
 
Springtime, springtime, April rings
The squirrel plays hide-and-seek behind his bushy tail
Springtime, springtime, the toad is on the go
Looking at himself in a water pool, he thinks he's very beautiful
 
And the turtle travels, all wedding guests are waiting for her
At the beautiful marriage of two turtledoves
Springtime, springtime, April rings
And when I hear it, I have a satisfied heart
 
I have a satisfied heart
I have a satisfied heart
