I love
I love you
I love
I love you
I love
Love you

When we were children
We would love in secret
Who were we nice to?
Only to uncles and aunts

And the poor girls suffered
Those sweethearts, they'd just get beaten up
And what we really felt
We whispered only in the Bet language

I love
I love you
I love
I love you

Love is a beautiful word
It's a wonderous prayer, it's a language
Love is good to me
It will always overcome
And we shall speak in a language of love

I love
I love you
I love
I love you

I dream and I wake up to three words
And what is the world? â€“ Three words
And that is how I feel now
Just like back then, in the Bet language

I love
I love you
I love
I love you

I love
I love you
I love
I love you

I love
I love you
