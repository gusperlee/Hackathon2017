You really can change country
If you don't like the rain
Go and live in the sun of Italy, if you want

You really can change your guy
If you don't like my song
And if you want, you can even make the revolution

But there will always be violins
To play love songs
But there will always be songs
Which say that it's for ever

But there will always be lovers
To end up in Cherbourg
But there will always be children
To swear a great love

You really can wear jeans
Trousers or a dinner jacket
Live like a man, be free, if you want

You really can say that marriage
Isn't really for your age
I know this feeling
For you, life is only a journey

But there will always be violins
To play love songs
But there will always be songs
Which say that it's for ever

But there will always be lovers
To end up in Cherbourg
But there will always be children
To swear a great love

But there will always be violins
To play love songs
But there will always be songs
Which say that it's for ever

But there will always be lovers
To end up in Cherbourg
But there will always be children
To swear a great love
