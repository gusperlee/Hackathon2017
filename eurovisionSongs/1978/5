I said: "It would never work"
You said: "Let us try"
I said: "I'm a travelling man who will only make you cry"
And when the feeling hit me and I had to move along
You said: "You were right, I guess, you must sing your song"
 
And a man is born to do one thing and I was born to sing
And I must take the good times and the bad times that it brings
And I missed you in the morning, but most of all at night
And I couldn't stop the music, though I tried with all my might
 
I lie in bed and watch the shadows moving on the wall
And the loneliness is killing me, so I turn the radio on
And I need you now, I want you, in the slow morning light
And the music makes it easier, but it doesn't make it right
 
And a man is born to do one thing and I was born to sing
And I must take the good times and the bad times that it brings
And I missed you in the morning but most of all at night
And I couldn't stop the music, though I tried with all my might
 
Some day, I hope, you will understand why I live this way
Songs keep moving in my head, this music I must play
So I pack my bags and once again I get out on the road
Another day, maybe tonight, I might catch my soul
 
And a man is born to do one thing and I was born to sing
And I must take the good times and the bad times that it brings
And I missed you in the morning, oh, but most of all at night
And I couldn't stop the music, though I tried with all my might
 
And a man is born to do one thing and I was born to sing
And I must take the good times and the bad times that it brings
And I missed you in the morning, oh, but most of all at night
And I couldn't stop the music
(Couldn't stop the music)
No, I couldn't stop the music
Because I...
Hey, I was born...
Born to sing
Born to sing
Born to sing
Born to sing
