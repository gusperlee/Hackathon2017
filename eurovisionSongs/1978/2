Love puts coloured pencils in your heart
So you can draw the world
Love, you become a musician
For a blonde, even a real little Chopin

Love is so fantastic
It puts happiness in music
It laughs about the whole symphony
Love makes life change

Love puts a fabulous look in your eyes
So that your whole face changes
Love gives you wings
So you can climb heaven onto the seventh floor

Love is so fantastic
It puts happiness in music
It laughs about the whole symphony
Love makes life change

Love is a great magician
That can change your sorrow in less than a second
Love, to cut a long story short
It gives you youth in all corners of the world

Love is so fantastic
It puts happiness in music
It laughs about the whole symphony
Love makes you sing about life

Life
