The little girl who played with a hoop
Say do you remember it?
The little boy who played with a ball
Yes, I remember it
Looking at the Italian sailing ships
Oh yes, it was good
There was a little park with swings
And you gave me your hand

In the gardens of Monaco
Chaplin could have met Garbo
Vadim maybe embraced Bardot
Like you and me
In the gardens of Monaco
Among the flowers, between the birds
Juliet must have met Romeo
Like you and me

The little girl who threw sand at me
Say, do you remember it?
The little boy who stole cherries
I loved him well
I loved you for a long time
And you know that nothing has changed
At the clear fountain
There is always love to share

In the gardens of Monaco
Chaplin could have met Garbo
Vadim maybe embraced Bardot
Like you and me
In the gardens of Monaco
Among the flowers, between the birds
Juliet must have met Romeo
Like you and me

In the gardens of Monaco
Someone will write a new scenario
For you and me â€“ it'll be the most beautiful
In the gardens of Monaco
