Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
We'll go round the world
With my pretty threemaster
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
 
We will only have as friends
The wandering breeze
And the midday sun
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
 
Go, my ship, go
Let your mast dance, let your sail flap
Go, my ship, go
For her and me, drift over there
 
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Choose the most beautiful port of call
And I offer you a paradise
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
 
Do you want the sky of Capri
Or the palaces of Bengal
Or the sun of Hawaii?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
 
Go, my ship, go
Let your mast dance, let your sail flap
Go, my ship, go
For her and me, yes, but look at that
 
My ship is very small
It sleeps in a bottle
And I dream as well
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
 
When the night comes, we leave
To discover thousand wonders
Of which I don't know the name
No, no, no, no, no, no
 
Go, my ship, go
Let your mast dance, let your sail flap
Go, my ship, go
For her and me, drift over there
 
Someday my pretty threemaster
Will take me far from here
In a wonderful land
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
