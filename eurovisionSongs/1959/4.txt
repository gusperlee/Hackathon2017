Unknown sky, unknown stars, endless like eternity
Searching restless in the distance sadly the past
 
From somewhere comes over the sea a melody of love
Longing and pain fill my heart
I never forget our time together
 
Oh, fairytale of luck, please come back
Don't let me be lonely
I didn't know that my heart will break
Why am I so alone?
 
From somewhere comes over the sea this melody of love
Even if you don't think about it
This time, I'll never forget
 
Oh, fairytale of luck, please come back
Don't let me be lonely
I didn't know that my heart will break
Why am I so alone?
 
From somewhere comes over the sea this melody of love
Even if you don't think about it
This time, I'll never forget
This time, I'll never forget
