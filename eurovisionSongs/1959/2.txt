Sing, sing, sing, little birdie
Sing, sing, sing it
 
There's a bird on a branch
There's a branch on a tree
There's a tree in the meadow
And that's where I long to be
 
'Neath that bird on a branch
'Neath that branch on a tree
'Neath that tree in the meadow
Where you said you love me
 
Sing, little birdie, sing your song
Sing, you'll help our love along
Sing, little birdie up above
Sing a song of love
 
There's a bird on a branch
There's a branch on a tree
Where we carved our initials there
For all the world to see
 
'Neath that bird on a branch
'Neath that branch on a tree
Where we promised our true love
For all eternity
 
Sing, little birdie, sing your song
Sing, you'll help our love along
Sing, little birdie up above
Sing a song of love
 
When the years pass on by
And we're wed, you and I
And the bluebirds are singing
Their sweet love songs in the sky
 
We will dream of that bird
On a branch, on a tree
And that tree in the meadow
Where you said you love me
 
Sing, little birdie, sing your song
Sing, you'll help our love along
Sing, little birdie up above
Sing a song of love
 
Sing, little birdie, sing your song
Sing, you'll help our love along
Sing, little birdie up above
Sing a song of love
