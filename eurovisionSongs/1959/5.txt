If you love fully, you love entirely
You're no divided nature
And you're faithful, faithful to amour
Then I want to be loved back
Therefore listen to me, my friend
 
For ooh, I'd wish I were you
Ooh, how I'd love me
Pat my cheek and stroke my hair
And give me sun and spring
A thousand kisses and a thousand caresses
I'd often grant myself
So ooh, I'd wish I were you
Ooh, how I'd hug me
What a whirl and what a life
And what a perspective
Yes, ooh, I'd wish I were you
 
That's why I ask you: If you walked the same path
And if you met you in the play of the kisses
If, on the other hand, you were me
When we are ninety, we'll say: Who's who's?
Enchanting you, I sing like now:
Da doo da da dey da doo
 
So ooh, I'd wish I were you
Ooh, but if one day, you ask me to marry you
Then I'll say: You know, it went as it should
Then you'll marry me
So ooh, it was good that you were you
 
That's why I ask you: If you walked the same path
And if you met you in the play of the kisses
If, on the other hand, you were me
When we are ninety, we'll say: Who's who's?
Enchanting you, I sing like now:
Da doo da da dey da doo
 
So ooh, I'd wish I were you
Ooh, but if one day, you ask me to marry you
Then I'll say: You know, it went as it should
Then you'll marry me
So ooh, it was good that you were you
