I wanted your heart to be a closet with a little door
And that I could look in the little interior
Then you had to be sincere, good or bad, but true
And then you'd soon say, when I asked: "Are you faithful?"
 
A bit, everyone is in love at least once, you know that
You want to be sensible, but you forget that
As soon as you listen to what Amor whispers
Then you know, it will be something like Faust and Gretchen
With little rendezvous in a little café
And strolling in the moonshine
 
With smell of roses
And kissing goodbye at the door
The night is blue, you whisper mouth to mouth
I swear eternal allegiance to you
 
A bit, you were in love more than once, mister, you know that
Your heart came up with a little idea more than once
You were sorry, but ah you know, sometimes you forget
Maybe a bit too soon, your little oath of loyalty
 
But actually, I'm happy that my heart has no door either
Because you never know what may live there in the interior
I'm willing to promise, when we get engaged
And you ask: "Are you faithful?", I'll never say to you...
 
With smell of roses
And kissing goodbye at the door
The night is blue, you whisper mouth to mouth
I swear eternal allegiance to you
 
A bit, you were in love more than once, mister, you know that
Your heart came up with a little idea more than once
You were sorry, but ah you know, sometimes you forget
Maybe a bit too soon, your little oath of loyalty
