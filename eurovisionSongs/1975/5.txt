I fell asleep, listening to your voice
Forgetting my life in your niche, in your niche
I woke up, I have found your voice back
And I knew how to love, tell me why, tell me why

You are my only love, you're my existence
You have given me love, you have given me the chance
To understand today that I lived for you
To know that my life doesn't exist without you

Since you're going to steal the memories of my childhood
Let me keep them just the time, just the time
To see again my adolescence, running in the forests
And letting the wind singing for you, singing for you

You are my only love, you're my existence
You gave me love, you gave me the chance
To understand today that I lived for you
To know that my life doesn't exist without you
