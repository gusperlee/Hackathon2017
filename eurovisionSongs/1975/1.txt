When you feelin' all right, everything is up-tight
Try to sing a song that goes ding ding-a-dong
There will be no sorrow when you sing tomorrow
And you walk along with your ding-dang-dong
 
Ding-a-dong every hour, when you pick a flower
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone
Ding-a-dong, listen to it, maybe it's a big hit
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone
Sing ding-ding-dong
 
When you feelin' all right, everything is up-tight
Listen to sing a song that goes ding ding-a-dong
And the world looks sunny, everyone is funny
When they sing a song that goes ding-dang-dong
 
Ding-a-dong every hour, when you pick a flower
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone
Ding-a-dong, listen to it, maybe it's a big hit
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone
Sing ding-ding-dong
 
(Ding-dang-dong, ding-a-dang-dong)
When you think it's all over, they let me down
Dry your tears and forget all your sorrow
Try to smile while you say goodbye
(Ding-dong ding-dong)
Ding-dang-dong when you'll wake up tomorrow
When the sun is up in the sky
 
When you feelin' all right, everything is up-tight
Try to sing a song that goes ding ding-a-dong
There will be no sorrow when you'll sing tomorrow
And you walk along with your ding-dang-dong
 
Ding-a-dong every hour, when you pick a flower
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone
Ding-a-dong, listen to it, maybe it's a big hit
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone
 
Ding-a-dong every hour, when you pick a flower
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone
Ding-a-dong, listen to it, maybe it's a big hit
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone
Sing ding-ding-dong
