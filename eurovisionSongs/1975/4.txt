And a good day to you, artist from no matter where
Who makes the days happy or sad, you who changes all
You offer us music like a present
You, magician of the new times

And good morning to you, painter of the light
Who knows all the colours of the universe
You're going to make from the year two thousand
The most beautiful millennium in the world's history

(It's time) to buy colours
(It's time) to begin the work
(It's time) You, the composer
To give all your heart

(It's time) And if you begin
(Now) Tomorrow it'll be ready
(It's time) You do what you want
Take all your time
(But don't take too much, please)

And good morning to you, artist, the great author
The brilliant illusionist, the famous actor
You're going to change the world for us, you're going to sing
To make us forget the past

(It's time) to buy colours
(It's time) to begin the work
(It's time) You, the composer
To give all your heart

(It's time) And if you begin
(Now) Tomorrow it'll be ready
(It's time) You do what you want
Take all your time
(But don't take too much, please)

(It's time) to buy colours
(It's time) to begin the work
(It's time) You, the composer
To give all your heart

(It's time) And if you begin
(Now) Tomorrow it'll be ready
(It's time) You do what you want
Take all your time

(It's time) to buy colours
(It's time) to begin the work
(It's time) You, the composer
To give all your heart

(It's time)
