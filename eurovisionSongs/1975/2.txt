Tonight
 
Let me be the one who's lovin' you tonight
Let me be the one who really holds you tight
I'll even bring along a magic moon
Just to make you feel all right
So let me be the one who's lovin' you tonight
 
Let me be the one who takes you by the hand
(Let me be the one)
Let me be the one who always understands
(Let me be the one)
Everybody knows we've been good friends
But I think the time is right
So let me be the one who's lovin' you tonight
 
You and I could have an affair
(All you gotta do is...)
Make sweet music, go anywhere
Building highways taking us there
As long as I know you really care
Won't you show me you care?
 
Oh... come on
Let me be the one who's lovin' you tonight
Let me be the one who really holds you tight
I'll even bring along a magic moon
Just to make you feel all right
So let me be the one who's lovin' you tonight
 
Doo doo doo doo...
Won't you show me you care?
 
Oh... come on
Let me be the one who takes you by the hand
Let me be the one who always understands
Everybody knows we've been good friends
But I think the time is right
So let me be the one who's lovin' you tonight
 
Let me be the one who's lovin' you
Tonight (Tonight)
Tonight (Tonight)
Tonight (Tonight)
Tonight
