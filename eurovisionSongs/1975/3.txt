After a few weeks in here
I already feel like another woman
May everything go on wheels
Now, now, now

Next to you, there I am
Love, I'm all yours
It almost seems like a century
When making love

It was kissing in the cinema
It was my Sunday
It was finding a hidden corner
It was, was, was blushing in public (Love)
It was talking in secret code (about love)
It was getting home before midnight
It was

The stories I made up for my parents
The girlfriends I never really met
The mail between the linen
It was now, now

Now I challenge the world
A love when it's mine, it's mine
It almost seems like a century
When making love

It was kissing in the cinema
It was my Sunday
It was finding a hidden corner
It was, it was
It was blushing in public (Love)
It was talking in secret code (about love)
It was getting home before midnight
It was, it was

Na na na na na na na... (Love)
Na na na na na na na... (About love)
It was getting home before midnight
It was, it was
Na na na na na na na...
Na na na na na na na...
Na na na na na na...
It was, it was, it was
