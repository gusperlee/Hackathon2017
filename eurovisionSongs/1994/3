Ooh... feel the rhythm, baby
Where's a party?
Where's a party tonight?

Is there anybody flying with me to the moon?
I need a kick to have a successful evening
Where's a party?
Where's a party, baby?

Mmm... it's so simple, I just want to have fun
Preferably everything and not just something
Where's a party?
Where's a party tonight?

Well then, shake it, take it, make it all right
Again, once more, because today is today
So if we're gonna do it, let's do it right, it will be a long night

So rock me, baby, everything is the same today
The longer the better, and once again
Come on, let's do what gives fun and pleasure

We're giving a party, we're giving a party
We're giving a party, we're giving a party
Whoa... a party tonight

I have that feeling in my stomach, tonight I will find the man
Mmm... who really will turn me on
Where's a party?
Where's a party, baby?

I have exactly the same hip hop feeling as you
Don't stay at home, I know what I'm going to do
Where's a party?
Where's a party tonight?

Well then, shake it, take it, make it all right
Again, once more, because today is today
So if we're gonna do it, let's do it right, it will be a long night

So rock me, baby, everything is the same today
The longer the better, and once again
Come on, let us do what gives fun and pleasure

We're giving a party, we're giving a party
We're giving a party, we're giving a party
Whoa... a party tonight
(We're giving a party, we're giving a party)

We're giving a party (Oh yeah)
We're giving a party (Oh yeah)
We're giving a party (Oh yeah)
We're giving a party
Whoa... a pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-party tonight
(We're giving a party)
A pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-party

Look at this guy, he's always looking over here
You're talking about this one, no he likes me much more
With the one I mean, you both won't have a chance
Better we forget them, come on let's dance
Dance, yeah, dance, yeah
Dance (dance)
At a party tonight
(We're giving a party)
(A pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-party)
Whoa... a party tonight
