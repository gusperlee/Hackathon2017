Swiftly movin' on
The days I see
Often ask myself
What I really wanna be
 
To dream of an aim
To reach it with fame
Not easy to say
There's will, there's a way
 
More than love
What music gives to me
Body and soul
Live in reality
 
Glistening on a star
Of promises and dreams
Some take me for a laugh
But they don't know what it means
 
To tell you the truth
I'll never change my youth
Not easy to say
There's will, there's a way
 
More than love
What music gives to me
Body and soul
Livin' in harmony
 
More than love
(Please, God, hear me now)
What music gives to me
(You gotta help me, you gotta help me)
Body and soul
Live in reality
(Ho, ho)
 
More than love
(Please, God)
What music gives to me
(You gotta help me, yeah)
Body and soul
There for eternity
 
This life is what I own
Gotta make it through
I'm liftin' up my heart
And I'm givin' it to you
