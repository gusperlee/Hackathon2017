My world is so common
Under a white-black sky
The people are cut out of grey pages
From the interior of books

They are beautiful from the background romance
You are tired of a newspaper that is cut out
And I... I'm white, a clean card
Amongst you

I was not Eve
I had not stolen heaven
Though I'm tired of tears
My tears, so many tears
I'm born to love me

I was not Eve
I had not stolen heaven
Don't blame it on me once more
That's not me, that's not me
Not me, I'm not Eve

The sky blows chilly
Hell bows deeply with its flames to its feet
And I... a marionette of paper, I have to play

I was not Eve
I had not stolen heaven
Though I'm tired of tears
My tears, so many tears
I was born to love
I know it

Before I turn to ashes
I want to be a big flame
I want to look down on earth
Want to warm up the sky with dreams

(I was not Eve)
(I had not stolen heaven)
Yes, yes, yes, yes...
(I was not Eve)
(I had not stolen heaven)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes...
