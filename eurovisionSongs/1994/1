Rock 'n' roll kids

I remember sixty-two
I was sixteen and so were you
And we lived next door on the avenue
 
Jerry Lee was big and Elvis too
Blue jeans and blue suede shoes
And we never knew what life held in store
We just wanted to rock 'n' roll forever more
 
We were the rock 'n' roll kids
Rock 'n' roll was all we did
And listenin' to those songs on the radio
I was yours and you were mine
That was once upon a time
Now we never seem to rock 'n' roll anymore
 
Now Johnny's in love with the girl next door
And Mary's down at the record store
They don't wanna be around us no more
 
Golden oldies, but we hardly speak
Too busy running to a different beat
Hard to understand we were once like them
How I wish we could find those rock 'n' roll days again
 
We were the rock 'n' roll kids
Rock 'n' roll was all we did
And listenin' to those songs on the radio
I was yours and you were mine
That was once upon a time
Now we never seem to rock 'n' roll anymore
 
I was yours and you were mine
That was once upon a time
Now we never seem to rock 'n' roll
We just never seem to rock 'n' roll anymore
