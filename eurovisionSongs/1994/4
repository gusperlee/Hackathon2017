Nothing is there, only the light-less night
Only the tongue-tied distress, a vain hope
No faith, no love
No one to stroke my hand

Whom can I tell my sins
To be sure that they are forgiven?
Whom can I tell my sins, my God?

The night is cold, but there remains a longing for light
When the swallows move south
My body is chilling during that dream
While the ardour slumbers in the birds of fire

Whom can I tell my sins
To be sure that they are forgiven?
Whom can I tell my sins, my God?

It never erupts
It will stay away of the bareness
Of my blindfold eyes
My God, tell me why

Salty tears
In spite of nobody dying and no children being born

How can I tell my sins
To be sure that they are forgiven?
Whom can I tell my sins
To get rid of my heavy guilt
To be sure that they are forgiven?
Whom can I tell my sins, my God?
