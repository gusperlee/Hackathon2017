There is a harbour where hardly a ship sails
And when one does, it sails to the undetermined distance
And it comes, when it arrives, from very far away
And someone gets out and comes across the sea
With a cargo from the stars made of glass
 
And they built on the quay of the past
A room with a seaview
And with walls made of dreams to combat reality
Because they didn't like it much
 
In the waiting room for great luck
Many, many people are waiting
They're waiting since yesterday for tomorrow's luck
And living with wishes for the day after tomorrow
And forgetting that it's still today
Oh... those poor, poor people
 
And they looked at the sea and they also saw the ship
Just as it was leaving for the undetermined distance
And they chased it right behind on their dreams
And didn't see him coming across the sea
With a cargo from the stars made of glass
 
And he passed along the quay of the past
And simply ignored the people in the room
Went straight out into reality
And there people saw him smiling
 
In the waiting room for great luck
Many, many people are waiting
They're waiting since yesterday for tomorrow's luck
And living with wishes for the day after tomorrow
And forgetting that it's still today
Hah... those poor, poor people
 
And the fishermen sailed out in the morning
And the sky glowed into the undetermined distance
And then he came by and their nets were empty
Yet he raised the sun out of the sea for them
And carried it up to the stars
 
And it shone all through reality
And the boats danced in the light
Only in the room on the quay of the past
Was the sun not seen at all
 
In the waiting room for great luck
Many, many people are waiting
They're waiting since yesterday for tomorrow's luck
And living with wishes for the day after tomorrow
And forgetting that it's still today
Well... those poor people
