The birds of Holland are so musical
They already learn to twitter in their early youth
The blackbird, the thrush and the nightingale
So they can celebrate spring in Holland
 
It's no wonder, because nowhere the puddles are so blue
As in Holland, sir
As in Holland, madam
It's no wonder, because nowhere the grass is so full of dew
Are the girls so sweet, are the girls so faithfull
And that's why all the birds here are
So musical
So musical
So musical
 
Across the whole world I've heard birds sing
To the south, to the west, to the north
In many faraway countries I've heard birds sing
They sing little songs without words
 
The French birds sing toodledoo
Japanese birds sing toodledoo
Chinese birds sing toodledoo
But nowhere the birds sing so happily and cheerfully
As in Holland in spring in the meadow
 
The birds of Holland are so musical
They already learn to twitter in their early youth
The blackbird, the thrush and the nightingale
So they can celebrate the spring in Holland
 
It's no wonder, because nowhere the puddles are so blue
As in Holland, sir
As in Holland, madam
It's no wonder, because nowhere the grass is so full of dew
Are the girls so sweet, are the girls so faithfull
And that's why all the birds here are
So musical
So musical
So musical
