Refrain, colour of the sky, the scent of my twenties
Garden full of sun where I spent my childhood
Everywhere I've been looking for you, my distant love
Waiting along the path where you took my hand
 
The days passed away and we grew up
Love wounded us, time cured us
But lonesome and without spring
I run in vain through the woods, the fields
Say, do you remember our old loves?
 
The years pass away as quick as lightning
And upon the roofs of my concern pours the rain
Where did the caravels leave, stealing my heart
Carrying my dreams away from your memory?
I wanted you to come back like bygone
Carrying flowers to my shutter
And your youthfulness to my home
 
Refrain, colour of the rain, regret of my twenties
Sorrow, melancholy not to be a child anymore
But lonesome and far from you, along the roads where you are not
I go, crying the loves of my twenties
