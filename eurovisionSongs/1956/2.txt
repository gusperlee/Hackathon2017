On Sunday with Jimmy, on Monday with Jack
On Tuesday you go off with Johnny
 
That's how it is every night (That's how it is every night)
That's how it is every night (That's how it is every night)
I've never, never thought that of you
 
I give you flowers and drive you to the office
Take your mother every Sunday to the zoo
But on Wednesday Billy brings you home
And on Thursday you go out with Tommy
 
That's how it is every night (That's how it is every night)
That's how it is every night (That's how it is every night)
I've never, never thought that of you
 
I've loved you since you were a baby
Now I've been practicing the boogie and the cha-cha-cha
But on Friday, on Friday you're dancing with Ben
Saturday with someone I don't even know
 
That's how it is every night (That's how it is every night)
That's how it is every night (That's how it is every night)
I've never, never thought that of you
 
But if you were thinking I've been sitting at home
I've been going out with someone else every day
 
That's how it is every night (That's how it is every night)
That's how it is every night (That's how it is every night)
You've never, never thought that of me
