Night over countryside and town, sleeping houses
The windows glitter, because of the star light
A girl standing by the window, looking up to the blue
Just fifteen years old, but still she's thinking
 
Little star up above, answer me, answer me
Is he coming, the man that I will love?
Yes, you'll probably know who he is
 
Will I read in his eye, the same answer, the same answer
That I think I see you twinkling to me now
You, little star?
 
Is he coming? Is he coming?
Yes, you'll probably know who he is
 
Will I read in his eye, the same answer, the same answer
That I think I see you twinkling to me now
You, little star?
