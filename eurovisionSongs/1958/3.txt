I think such a dream will never come back
I painted my hands and my face blue
Then suddenly I was ravished by the wind
And I started flying in the infinite sky
 
Flying, oh oh...
Singing, ohohoho...
Blue painted in the blue
Happy to be up there
 
And I was flying, flying happily
Higher than the sun and even higher
While the world was slowly disappearing, far beneath
A soft music was playing just for me
 
Flying, oh oh..
Singing, ohohoho...
Blue painted in the blue
Happy to be up there
 
But all the dreams fade away at dawn, because
While setting, the moon takes them away
But I keep dreaming in your beautiful eyes
Which are as blue as a sky quilted with stars
 
Flying, oh oh...
Singing, ohohoho...
In the blue of your blue eyes
Happy to be down here
 
And I keep flying happily
Higher than the sun and even higher
While the world is slowly disappearing in your blue eyes
Your voice is a soft music playing for me
 
Flying, oh oh...
Singing, ohohoho...
In the blue of your blue eyes
Happy to be down here
 
In the blue of your blue eyes
Happy to be down here with you
