The whole world needs love
Who likes to be alone?
A little bit of love
Should it be different with me?
 
In the big gear of the world
Even the smallest stone has
Another little stone
Should it be different with me?
No
 
My heart too has longing
And it needs a second heart
That tries to understand me
In happy days, but also in bad days
 
And if the world were cold and gloomy
It wouldn't be kissed by sunshine
And every heart needs love
Should it be different with me?
No, it can't be different
 
The cheek wants to be touched softly
The mouth needs tenderness
The hand, it wants to be caressed
That's how it is today and for all times
The whole world needs love
 
My heart too has longing
And it needs a second heart
That tries to understand me
In happy days, but also in bad days
 
And if the world were cold and gloomy
Then it wouldn't be kissed by sunshine
And every heart needs love
Should it be different with me?
No, it can't be different
