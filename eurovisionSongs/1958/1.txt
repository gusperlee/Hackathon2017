Sleep, my love
The sun is still far from the day
We have all the time to love
And the night understands us
 
Sleep, my love
Protected by my arms that surround
Your sleep with a curtain of happiness
Sleep onto my heart
 
I'm a king that holds his whole kingdom in his fingers
And that shivers of seeing this enchanted kingdom falling down
 
Sleep, my love
My princess, locked up in her tower
With all the refrains of the night
My sleepy princess
 
I'm following your soul step by step on its way of joy
And I amuse myself by leaning over your starry sleep
 
Sleep, my love
The sun is still far from the day
We have all the time to love
And the night understands us
 
Sleep, my love
Protected by my arms that surround
Your sleep with a curtain of happiness
Sleep onto my heart
 
I hear the voice of your life that beats so close to me
And I feel like a very gentle blow that caresses my cheek
 
Sleep, my love
My princess, locked up in her tower
I see the morning smile
Here's the sun of tomorrow
The great sun of the eternal love
Sleep, my love
The sun is still far from the day
We have all the time to love
And the night understands us
