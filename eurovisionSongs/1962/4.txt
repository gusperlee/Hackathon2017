(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)
(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)
 
I was strollin' through the park one evenin'
When a strange feelin' came over me
A vision of loveliness came in view
It was love, it was plain to see
 
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
All the bells were ringin'
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
All the world was singin'
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
She's got me in a whirl
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
She's my ring-a-ding girl
(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)
(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)
 
Very shortly, we were dating steady
I asked her if her love was true
She gave me the answer with her lips
Every time that we kissed, I knew
 
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
All the bells were ringin'
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
All the world was singin'
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
She's got me in a whirl
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
She's my ring-a-ding girl
(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)
(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)
 
I have waited patiently, my darlin'
When can we fix the date and the time?
She answer so softly and tenderly:
"I can't wait till the day you're mine"
 
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
All the bells were ringin'
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
All the world was singin'
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
She's got me in a whirl
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
She's my ring-a-ding girl
(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)
(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)
 
We were married and the bells were ringin'
It's a day that I'll never forget
I had that strange feelin' once again
Just the same as the day we met
 
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
All the bells were ringin'
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
All the world was singin'
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
She's got me in a whirl
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
She's my ring-a-ding girl
