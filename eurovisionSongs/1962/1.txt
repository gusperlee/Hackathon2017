A first love, first love, first love
Is never forgotten, never forgotten, never forgotten
A first love, we always look for it
In other loves, we pursue it our whole life
 
It confused us and made us dream and made us tremble
That first love, first love, first love
But the child that we are, the child that we remained
Will always hum in memory of this love
 
And you, and you who I loved
What did you make of yourself?
What have you done without me?
And I, I who lost you
What have I done more?
Was I so much more lucky?
Did we actually know...
 
That a first love, first love, first love
Is never forgotten, never forgotten, never forgotten?
That a first love, we always look for it
In other loves, we pursue it our whole life?
 
That all those kisses that we have stolen rather than given
Those innocent gestures engaged us for so long?
No, the children that we still were back then
Didn't suspect much, they were delighted
That a first love, their first love was so strong
