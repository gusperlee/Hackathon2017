Say nothing, say nothing, we love each other
That's the true poem
And I'm feeling so well
My body drowning in yours
 
I'm as in a wave
Where my happiness roams
It's so profound, profound
I feel myself streaming in the depths
 
Say nothing, words are silly
For someone who isn't a poet
They're bubbles that blow
The words, it kills the dreams
 
My hands play on your dress
Nothing of you is revealed
In my two closed arms
Let me, let me love you
 
Say nothing, say nothing, my soul
Your eyes possess it like a flame
The words are all the same
Say nothing, say nothing, I love you
 
I don't know anymore where we are
You are a woman and I - a man
And if one dies of that
I want to die a hundred times
A hundred times, a hundred times
A hundred times
