For others a journey to the South is something chic and fine
But two little Italians would rather be back home
 
Two little Italians, dreaming of Naples
Of Tina and Marina, who've been waiting for them a long time
Two little Italians, all on their own
For others a journey to the South is something chic and fine
But both Italians would rather be back home
 
Oh Tina, oh Marina, if we get to see each other again
Oh Tina, oh Marina, then it will be wonderful again
 
Two little Italians never forget their home
The palm trees and the girls on the beach of Naples
Two little Italians, they understand
That for others, a journey to the South is something chic and fine
But both Italians would rather be back home
 
Oh Tina, oh Marina, if we get to see each other again
Oh Tina, oh Marina, then it will be wonderful again
 
Two little Italians at the station, everyone knows them there
They come every evening for the express train to Naples
Two little Italians, looking at the train as it leaves
For others a journey to the South is something chic and fine
But both Italians would rather be back home
 
Oh Tina, oh Marina, if we get to see each other again
Oh Tina, oh Marina, then it will be wonderful again
