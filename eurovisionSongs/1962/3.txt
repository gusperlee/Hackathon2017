Little boy, at the end of your childhood
Little boy, you'll have to quit
You'll leave like someone goes on holiday
On the paths of liberty
 
Little boy, that's how life leads us
And the children escape from their parents
I had joy, soon I will have pain
And I'll understand you, I love you and I wait for you
 
I hear you sleeping and your childhood dreams
Are memories for me for when you'll be grown-up
Bigger than me, tomorrow already
 
Little boy, I hqve to tell you
Little boy, and you won't believe it
But sometimes I packed my suitcases
And quickly unpacked them because of you
 
Little boy, at the day of the great path
I will be alone and you won't come
But I'll say: "My son is on a journey"
"He went a lot further, a lot further than me"
Little boy, at the end of your childhood
Little boy, you'll have to quit
You'll leave like someone goes on holiday
On the paths of liberty
 
Little boy, that's how life leads us
And the children escape from their parents
I had joy, soon I will have pain
