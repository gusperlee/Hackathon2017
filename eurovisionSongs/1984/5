Go forward, go forward in life
Remember the history of mankind
Heart and fists, go forward
Maybe you will revive Rome

Go forward, go forward in life
Be a free bird, go
Wings and beak, go forward
But fly higher than the cats

The train of the days rides in your head
A lot of bends are often waiting for you

Go forward, go forward in life
Don't listen to all the laws
You would perish, go forward
All the liberties growl on you

(Go forward, go forward in life)
Neither servant nor king
(Be a poet without executioners, go)
Sing as strong as you can
(Ink and words, go forward)
Go forward in life
(Write down the madness of your inner self)

The train of the time sometimes stops
Make the most of it, change your mind

Go forward, go forward in life
Help yourself, heaven will help you
Stand up and walk, go forward
Someone else said it before me

(Go forward, go forward in life)
Go forward in life
(Remember the history of mankind)
Heart and fists, go forward
(Heart and fists, go forward)
Maybe you will revive Rome
