Long distance USA, last night I heard him say
He's been away too long, now he's coming home
Be on the morning plane, if I still feel the same
I should be waiting 'cause he'd be all alone
 
I'm in Arrivals by the time he had said
I search the information board and it read
"Terminal Three: flight's on time"
 
Staring into a space, searching through every face
He's been away too long now, he must have changed
Another time and place can never quite erase
The way he turned his back and walked away
 
I repeated all the words he had said
Until a voice came through into my head
"Terminal Three: flight's on time"
 
Fly to me on the wings of all you meant to me
Memories of the dreams that all tomorrow can be
For you and me
"Terminal Three: flight's on time"
 
Fly to me on the wings of all you meant to me
Memories of the dreams that all tomorrow can be
For you and me
"Terminal Three: flight's on time"
 
Long distance USA, last night I heard him say
Could I be waiting 'cause he'd be all alone
I told him nothing's changed and I still feel the same
He's been away too long
 
Come on home
(Long distance USA, last night I heard him say)
Come on home
(Could I be waiting 'cause he'd be all alone)
Come on home
(I told him nothing's changed and I still feel the same)
Come on home
(He's been away too long)
"Terminal Three: flight's on time"
 
Long distance USA, long distance USA
Long distance USA, long distance USA
Long distance USA, long distance USA
Long distance USA, long distance USA
