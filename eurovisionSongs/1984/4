The rain is beating on the window
I stare at it, drearily
There isn't a lot, that indicates
That the sun will come out again
Then the doorbell rings
And who do you think steps in?
You do, and at once the rain is gone
At least in my mind

That's just what I'm waiting for
That's just what makes me live
The big sensation, a wonderful gift
That suddenly appears out of nowhere
That's just what I'm waiting for
That's just what makes me float through the air
And if I dream, I beg you:
Don't wake me up anymore

You stand a bit shy and hesitate
Then at last tells me
That you've realized
What I've known for so long
You stare past me, frightened
At the word 'love'
Calm down, I'll never get tired
Of that word, you know

That's just what I'm waiting for
That's just what makes me live
The big sensation, a wonderful gift
That suddenly appears out of nowhere
That's just what I'm waiting for
That's just what makes me float through the air
And if I dream, I beg you:
Don't wake me up anymore

We run down the street hand in hand
And don't care if the rain increases
I get a bit proud and shy
Every time you send me a smile

That's just it...
That's just what I'm waiting for
That's just what makes me live
The big sensation, a wonderful gift
That suddenly appears out of nowhere
That's just what I'm waiting for
That's just what makes me float through the air
And if I dream, I beg you:
Don't wake me up anymore
