Lightning and thunder, magical wonders
Suddenly one day it happened, oh... what a piece of luck
(You are a lucky devil)

One day in the city (you walked there thinking)
On the forecourt (you saw something glistening)
It felt like I had wings
Oh... what a wonderful dream

Diggi-loo diggi-ley, everybody's looking at me
When I'm walking in my golden shoes
I danced in the street
And the whole world was smiling

Diggi-loo diggi-ley, the sky was opening up
You hardly believe your eyes
Oh... and I almost begin to fly
In my golden shoes

I have visions for millions
Golden shoes for you and happiness is a fact
(Tell us more, we trust your word)

Imagine an obstacle, (you'll fly over it)
Wings on your shoes (is all you need)
Oh... I can become what I want
In my magical world

Diggi-loo diggi-ley, everybody's looking at me
When I'm walking in my golden shoes
I danced in the street
And the whole world was smiling

Diggy-loo diggy-ley, the sky was opening up
You hardly believe your eyes
Oh... and I almost begin to fly
In my golden shoes

It was a wishful dream, but I have to admit
When I woke up, I woke up with pleasure
Me, a singer and dancer
Oh... oh...

Diggi-loo diggi-ley, the sky was opening up
You hardly believe your eyes
Oh... I'd like to wish
For everyone golden shoes

Oh... I'd like to wish
For everyone golden shoes
