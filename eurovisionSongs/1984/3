Each evening
When the sun is setting
She goes for a walk
On the main road

With her grey sun hat (With her grey sun hat)
With her starch dress
Jasmine perfume (Jasmine perfume)
Varnished ankle boots

Lady, lady, lady
Uses blue make-up for her eyes
Although a thousand years ago
She lost her youth (Her youth)
When one summer day
She got disillusioned

Lady, lady, lady
Lives in her crystal world
She believes that he will return one day

She lives
In a rented room
On the wall hangs
The picture of a man

Her life passed by (Her life passed by)
In cotton clouds
In paper dreams (In paper dreams)
In search of her love

Lady, lady, lady
Uses blue make-up for her eyes
Although a thousand years ago
She lost her youth (Her youth)
When one summer day
She got disillusioned
