Od mazhiv hasade she'azavnu az	The field we left back then still turns to gold
Od ha'arets noset yevula	The land still produces its harvest
Ve'od yafim hem haleilot biChna'an	And the nights in Canaan are still beautiful
Terem hashemesh ola	Before the sun rises
 	 
Od rakevet chotsa sham pardes yarok	A train still crosses a green orchard there
Chasida od roga'at me'al	A stork still relaxes above
Ve'od nisa ha'arafel ba'emek	And the fog still carries in the valley
Bein hazricha vehatal	Between the sunrise and the dew

Kola od ole, kola lo nadam	Its voice still rises, its voice has not been silenced
Vegam haHora, hahi im haHei	And also the Hora, the one with the Hey
Shira memale libi le'olam	Its song fills my heart forever
 	 
Od shatim ananim al batei ha'ir	Clouds still float over the city houses
Vehayam melatef et hachol	And the sea caresses the sand
Ve'od nishma ech bilvavot po'em lo	And still we hear how in the hearts there beats
Zemer yashan umachol	An old refrain and a dance
 	 
Vegam haHora, hahi im haHei	And also the Hora, the one with the Hey
Kola od ole, kola lo nadam	Its voice still rises, its voice has not been silenced
Vegam haHora, hahi im haHei	And also the Hora, the one with the Hey
