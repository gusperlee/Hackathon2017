It's so nice
In the morning to get up to music
It makes you a little crazy
But the awakening is more euphoric

It follows you
Everywhere during the whole day
And all your worries
Will clear away in smoke immediately

If you like my music
Sing it with me
If you want to dance
Nobody will stop you

Isn't it magnificent?
Sing with a full voice
Bring about a vibration
To the whole world

The song
It's one of the most fantastic things
That's also why we sing
On every geographical surface
Prosperity
Is often found in music
And the good humour
It's like a really magical flower

If you like my music
Sing it with me
If you want to dance
Nobody will stop you

Isn't it magnificent?
Sing with a full voice
Bring about a vibration
To the whole world

If you like my music
Sing it with me
If you want to dance
Nobody will stop you

Isn't it magnificent?
Sing with a full voice
Bring about a vibration
To the whole world
