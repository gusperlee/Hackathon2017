Just like a flower at the beginning of winter
And just like a fire in an icy wind
Just like a doll that nobody wants anymore
That's how I feel on some days

Then I see the clouds above
And I hear the cries of the birds in the wind
I sing my song in fear of the dark
And hope that nothing happens

A bit of peace, a bit of sunshine
For this earth on which we're living
A bit of peace, a bit of joy
A bit of warmth, that's what I wish for

A bit of peace, a bit of dreams
And that people won't cry as often
A bit of peace, a bit of love
May I never lose hope again

I know my songs won't help very much
I'm just a girl who says what she feels
Alone I'm helpless, a bird in the wind
That feels that the storm begins

A bit of peace, a bit of sunshine
For this earth on which we're living
A bit of peace, a bit of joy
A bit of warmth, that's what I wish for

A bit of peace, a bit of dreams
And that people won't cry as often
A bit of peace, a bit of love
May I never lose hope again

Sing with me a little song
(A bit of peace, a bit of sunshine)
(For this earth on which we're living)
May the world live in peace
(A bit of peace, a bit of joy)
(A bit of warmth, that's what I wish for)

Sing with me a little song
(A bit of peace, a bit of dreams)
(And that people won't cry as often)
May the world live in peace
(A bit of peace, a bit of love)
(May I never lose hope again)
