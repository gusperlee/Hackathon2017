We can cross the sea, fly around the earth
Chase after adventure, look for gold
We can leave our homeland
Change our nose and our life
But above all we need love

Love we love you, more than ourselves
More than money, politics and songs
And even though you chain us up
Our heart beats like a butterfly's wings

We can believe in fantasy
Have eclectic tastes
Think in terms of Rossini or Travolta
We can go in for speed, yoga, business
Without love there is something missing

Love we love you, in spite of ourselves
You toss us to-and-fro like sailboats in the wind
And even though we're in your power
We feel free and soar as seagulls

Love we love you, in spite of ourselves
You carry us along like fish in the ocean
However we like the way you lead us
It is a bit crazy but we can't live without you

Love we love you, more than ourselves
More than money, politics and songs
Love we love you, love we love you
Our eyes are full of laughter and song
Our heart beats like a butterfly's wings
