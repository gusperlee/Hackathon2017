Nothing stays, nothing lives
Everything is erased, vanished like the sun in the rain
But above me, above you
Above everything there's

Only love, only love
Only love, and lives at every instant
Only love, only love
Only love, and lives

What's our life, little if you think about it
You would close your eyes, you wouldn't want to see
But behind the mistakes, the human torture
Above everything there's

Only love, only love
Only love, and lives at every instant
Only love, only love
Only love, and lives
And lives

Our life passes by, and whatever leaves, we're in pain
It doesn't come back, but something holds us together

Only love, only love
Only love, and lives at every instant
Only love, only love
Only love, and lives

Only love, only love
Only love, and lives
