You're a bit down in the mouth, do you think everything's all grey?
Yes, I know how it is, of course, you know it
But forget it for a second, let it disappear into the air
Grab your palette, because now we'll put on the colours

We're painting the town red and the sky white of star gleam
All that is grey and boring gets an extra patch of colour
Then we give the clothes of night a brushstroke or more
And only when the sun says goodmorning and gets to work
We'll say goodnight

The glasses you're wearing can colour the things that happen
So you don't see the joys others see
But you can borrow mine for a couple of hours if you like
Have a look around, open your eyes, come out and hammer away

We're painting the town red and the sky white of star gleam
All that is grey and boring gets an extra patch of colour
Then we give the clothes of night a brushstroke or more
And only when the sun says goodmorning and gets to work
We'll say goodnight

Are you still sitting inside
Rolling down the blinds
The joys have to be found
Just keep at it and come along
(Just keep at it and come along)

We're painting the town red and the sky white of star gleam
All that is grey and boring gets an extra patch of colour
Then we give the clothes of night a brushstroke or more
And only when the sun says goodmorning and gets to work
Yes, only when the sun says goodmorning and gets to work
We'll say goodnight
