Oh... whoa oh oh oh...

He played for whole days on his piano
He played classical music with note sheets
He played like a real pianist â€“ Mozart, Chopin, Liszt
I've found a new song for him to play
Whoa oh oh oh...

Rock me, baby, it doesn't matter what
Rock me, baby, just let it persist
Rock me, baby, this is nerve-wrecking
Whoa oh oh oh...

Rock me, baby, it doesn't matter what
Rock me, baby, just let is persist
Rock me, baby, just make it danceable

Now every day I hear the sound of the old piano
This song which is played without note sheets
Cause classical music is for listening and peace for the soul
And this song is played for dancing
Whoa oh oh oh...

Rock me, baby, it doesn't matter what
Rock me, baby, just let it persist
Rock me, baby, this is nerve-wrecking
Whoa oh oh oh...

Rock me, baby, it doesn't matter what
Rock me, baby, just let is persist
Rock me, baby, just make it danceable
Whoa oh oh oh...

Rock me, baby, it doesn't matter what
(Ooh... rock, babe)
Rock me, baby, just let is persist
(Ooh... rock, rock, rock)
Rock me, baby, this is nerve-wrecking
(Ooh... rock, babe)
(Rock me, baby) Whoa oh oh oh...

Rock me, baby, it doesn't matter what
(Ooh... rock, babe)
Rock me, baby, just let is persist
(Ooh... rock, rock, rock)
Rock me, baby, just make it danceable
(Ooh... rock, babe)
Just make it
(Ooh... rock, rock, rock)
Just make it...
(Ooh... rock, babe)
Whoa oh oh oh... danceable
