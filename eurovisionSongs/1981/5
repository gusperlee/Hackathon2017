One day, when the winds carry
One day, you and I are standing there
One day, when the dream reaches out
When our roads meet, we will understand each other

One day, we all understand
One day, when silence rules
One day, I find your hand
When our roads meet, we will understand each other

We carry a yearning, and wander around
Wander without seeing
Whatever happens, I will come to you
Stay even though it's late
Stay even though it's late

Oh... one day, when the winds carry
One day, you and I are standing there
One day, when the dream reaches out
When our roads meet, we will understand each other
