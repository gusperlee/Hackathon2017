(La lala... la lala... la lala...)

He came from the North and I was a sun-child
He said words stronger and softer than the cotton of the sky
He shared the bread and my father gave him a bed:
"You'll begin tomorrow, close to the grey oak"

I didn't dream of him, I didn't sleep
Stretched out near the grey oak, I was on the lookout for his step
And an entire burning winter, our love made the earth sing
Like a renewal, like a prayer

He was a snow-man and I was a sun-child
Spring on its roundabout unrolled its rainbows for us
If he wanted to leave, I even wouldn't have known how to cry
I would have kept the smile that he had given me

When men came, I didn't understand
He ran ahead of me, towards the grey oak
But he couldn't do anything, the trap was closed on him
They thanked my father, then they left

He returned to the North and I was a sun-child
He had his hands outside and on his back the cotton of the sky
He shared the bread and my father gave him a bed
That day seems far away for me, close to the grey oak

Hey, come back, I'm the sun-child
Hey, come back, I'm the sun-child
Sun, sun
