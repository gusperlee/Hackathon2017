Walking alone in my town
I felt that a song was coming to me
I approached and I could see
Some children singing

One came and told me: "Hey, old woman!"
"Don't you want to include your weary voice?"
"You'll see how easy it is to sing"
"If your heart is very happy"

If everybody wanted a song
That speaks of peace, that speaks of love
It would be easy to get us together
To live with an illusion

I want you to feel this song with me
To leave behind your bad mood
So you can step into life with a smile
And enjoy your condition

Sing my song at home alone
You'll understand that there's no pain
When you have the joy of living
And a heart to share

Close your eyes with me and say goodbye
To that song which taught me
To live today, not yesterday
A song which is of us both
Is your song

(Lala lalala lalala...)
Lalalala... lalalala...
(Lalalala la lalala lalala...)
Lalalala... lalalala...

Lalalala la lalala lalala...
Lalalala lalalala...
Lalalala la lalala lalala...
Lalalala lalalala...

Lalalala la...
