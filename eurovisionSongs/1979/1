Hallelujah to the world
Hallelujah, everyone will sing
With one single word
The heart is filled with much gratitude
And it also pounds: what a wonderful world

Hallelujah with the song
Hallelujah for a day that shines
Hallelujah for all that has been
And all that is yet to come
Hallelujah

Hallelujah to the world
Hallelujah, everyone will sing
And the great bells
Will echo with many sounds
And with us they will say Hallelujah

Hallelujah with the song
Hallelujah for a day that shines
Hallelujah for all that has been
And all that is yet to come
Hallelujah

Hallelujah for everything
Praise tomorrow and yesterday
Hallelujah and hold each other's hands
And sing from one heart
Hallelujah

Hallelujah with the song
Hallelujah for a day that shines
Hallelujah for all that has been
And all that is yet to come
Hallelujah

Hallelujah for all that has been
And all that is yet to come
Hallelujah
