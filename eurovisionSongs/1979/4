Hu, ha, hu, ha... hu, ha, hu, ha...
Hu, ha, hu, ha... hu, ha, hu, ha...
Hu, ha, hu, ha, hu, ha, hu, ha...

They were riding in competition with the steppe wind
A thousand men
Ha, hu, ha...
And one was riding in front, they all followed him blindly:
Genghis Khan
Ha, hu, ha...

The hoofs of their horses, they lashed in the sand
They carried fear and horror in every country
And neither flash nor thunder stopped them
Hu, ha...

Geng... Geng... Genghis Khan
Hey, riders; ho, people; hey, riders, always further
Geng... Geng... Genghis Khan
Come on brothers, drink brothers, fight brothers, on and on

Send for some vodka
Ho, ho, ho, ho...
Because we are Mongolians
Ha, ha, ha, ha...
And the devil gets us early enough

Geng... Geng... Genghis Khan
Hey, riders; ho, people; hey, riders, always furher
Geng... Geng... Genghis Khan
Hey, men; ho, men; dance men, like always

And you hear him laugh
Ho, ho, ho, ho...
Always laughing louder
Ha, ha, ha, ha...
And he empties the mug in one go

And each woman, that he liked
He took into his tent
Ha, hu, ha...
They said, a woman who did not love him
Did not exist anywhere in the world
Ha, hu, ha...

He fathered seven children in one night
And about his enemies he only laughed
Because nobody could resist his strength
Hu, ha...

Geng... Geng... Genghis Khan
Hey, riders; ho, people; hey, riders, always further
Geng... Geng... Genghis Khan
Come on brothers, drink brothers, fight brothers, on and on

Send for some vodka
Ho, ho, ho, ho...
Because we are Mongolians
Ha, ha, ha, ha...
And the devil gets us early enough

Geng... Geng... Genghis Khan
Hey, riders; ho, people; hey, riders, always furher
Geng... Geng... Genghis Khan
Hey, men; ho, men; dance men, like always

And you hear him laugh
Ho, ho, ho, ho...
Always laughing louder
Ha, ha, ha, ha...
And he empties the mug in one go
Ha... hu, ha, hu...
