It seemed life had no answers for me
No special meaning or plan
How could I be a happy man?
 
Then just like in a love song
You're here, making each day seem so clear
Now I can smile – I'm a happy man
 
I'm in love and I'm alive – happy man
Got the sun inside – happy man
I've got a girl on my mind
Love in my heart – happy man
 
I'm in love and I'm alive – happy man
Got the sun inside – happy man
So now the whole world can see
I've got all I need – I'm a happy man
 
And now you say it's happened to you
This love I'm feeling inside
Girl, you've made me a happy man
 
And I will share a lifetime with you
Making our dreams all come true
Now I can smile – I'm a happy man
 
I'm in love and I'm alive – happy man
Got the sun inside – happy man
I've got a girl on my mind
Love in my heart – happy man
 
I'm in love and I'm alive – happy man
Got the sun inside – happy man
So now the whole world can see
I've got all I need – I'm a happy man
 
I'm in love and I'm alive – happy man
Got the sun inside – happy man
I've got a girl on my mind
Love in my heart – happy man
 
I'm in love and I'm...
