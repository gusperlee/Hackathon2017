She arrived alone with summer
Came over and said hello
Our looks said more than words
As if a star from the sky
Had fallen into my hand
I only knew that her name was Julie

Julie, Julie
And I wanted that dream to last for long

I still remember the touch of that hand
Her face and her subtle look at me
I knew then that I love her madly
Like all the summer dreams
The day took her away
Only a memory of a July was left

Julie, Julie
And I wanted that dream to last for long

At night, I ask the skies
If that was only a dream
Or if it was really Julie kissing me that night
Tonight I'm alone by the sea
And the daylight had arrived
I asked the sea to give me back Julie and July

Julie, oh... Julie, oh...
Julie, oh... Julie
And I wanted that dream to last for long
Oh my Julie
