Stranger, what are you hiding from me in your dark eyes?
A faint nuance of light somewhere, but still

A stranger, that's how I feel about you
I beg you, let me know
Who do you want to be? Can you explain that to me?

Just like Mona Lisa has her smile
You are hiding a secret too
Stars, I see them, I would like to take one down for you

There beyond the sky is an eternity
If you want to discover it here with me
Take the first step and show me the way tonight
A feeling and I trust it
Then our love will never be strange again

The night is there for you and me
Forget what's around us
Let me come, let me be close to you

Just like Mona Lisa has her smile
You are hiding a secret too
Stars, I see them, I would like to take one down for you

There beyond the sky is an eternity
If you want to discover it here with me
Take the first step and show me the way tonight
A feeling and I trust it
Then our love will never be strange again
Then our love will never be strange again
