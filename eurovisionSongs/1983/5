I can't be alone
With all these unanswered questions
What did we both do wrong?
I still don't want to see any people
The luck of the others still hurts me
Why didn't we wake up earlier?

We were like spoiled children
Everyone only thought of himself

Consideration – nobody knew this word
And leniency – which nobody found at the other
And care – that never breaks what connected us

Insight – that everyone has his mistakes
And far-sight – life doesn't only take place today
And caution – that you don't break the other

Were we really just blind of love
Or just too easygoing?
Didn't we notice what we were missing?
Perhaps everything was going much too fast for us
Did only the night connect us?
Didn't we know that the day counts as well?

Did we lack the power to trust ourselves?
Was it fear for honest feelings?

Consideration – nobody knew this word
And leniency – which nobody found at the other
And care – that never breaks what connected us

Insight – that everyone has his mistakes
And far-sight – life doesn't only take place today
And caution – that you don't break the other
