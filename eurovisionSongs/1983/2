Listen, my brothers, I'm still alive
And both my eyes still look into the light
Many are my thorns, but also my flowers
And I have countless years ahead of me

I ask and I pray
Good thing hope is not yet lost

A song is passed from generation to generation
Like a eternal spring

I ask and I pray
Good thing hope is not yet lost

Alive, alive, alive
Yes, I'm still alive
This is the song that Grandpa sang yesterday to Dad
And today it's me

I'm still alive, alive, alive
The Nation of Israel is alive
This is the song that Grandpa sang yesterday to Dad
And today it's me

My days rumble (Alive, alive)
As do my nights (Alive, alive)
And in my skies, the pillar of fire still stands

I'll sing forever (Alive, alive)
I'll reach out my hands (Alive, alive)
To my friends from across the seas

I ask and I pray
Good thing hope is not yet lost

Alive, alive, alive
Yes, I'm still alive
This is the song that Grandpa sang yesterday to Dad
And today it's me

I'm still alive, alive, alive
The Nation of Israel is alive
This is the song that Grandpa sang yesterday to Dad
And today it's me

Listen, my brothers, I'm still alive
And both my eyes still look into the light
So kudos to all my guests
And to my sons who ask to return

I ask (I ask)
And I pray (I pray)
Good thing hope is not yet lost

Alive, alive, alive
Yes, I'm still alive
This is the song that Grandpa sang yesterday to Dad
And today it's me

I'm still alive, alive, alive
The Nation of Israel is alive
This is the song that Grandpa sang yesterday to Dad
And today it's me

Alive, alive, alive
I'm still alive, alive, alive
