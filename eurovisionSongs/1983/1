We, we were blue
A summer sky, a transparent ocean
We, we were two
And when we loved each other, time stood still

But time betrayed us
So why did you promise me the whole world?
Our love would have been enough
I didn't want an imaginary happiness
If life is a gift

If life is a gift
Given gift, recovered gift, stolen gift
Take love as a gift
Given gift, recovered gift, stolen gift
Happiness is too short

We, it was the child that I wanted
To give it to you in springtime

But time has all the rights
So why did you promise me the whole world
And the child that isn't there?
Today is my only imaginary happiness
If life is a gift

If life iswas a gift
Given gift, recovered gift, stolen gift
Take love as a gift
Given gift, recovered gift, stolen gift
Happiness is too short

(If life is a gift)
