If you like nature, lilacs and birdies
Muscadet, fried foods and the beautiful adventure
Follow the water side
 
You'll see a ballroom where you could get drunk
In Lisette's clear eyes, on the pom-poms of a musette ball
Before deciding in a kiss to dare everything
 
Like the water flows in the fountain, this song
Is the song that girls and boys each sing their own way
It will be in everybody's hearts, that's for sure
It will be there forever – the song of the beautiful love
 
Let's sing it again under the lilacs and lalala here and there
It's the beautiful love
 
However the autumn has come, the ballroom with closed shutters
Doesn't have lovers anymore, nobody comes when it's time
To dream along the water side
 
It's the ball of the dead leaves, which dance on the gravel
And go from door to door, taken along by the wind
Whirling by thousands, waiting for what? – For spring
 
Let's sing it again under the lilacs and lalala here and there
It's the beautiful love
The beautiful love
