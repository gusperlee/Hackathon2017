Goodbye then, my lass, stay well
I confess, my heart gives kind of a twinge
While I'm kissing you now
I love you
But the ship is leaving tonight
But the ship is leaving tonight
 
We met in fun, we courted a little
But what was carelessness, suddenly became serious
And you became everything to me
Now there's only you
But the ship is leaving tonight
Yes, the ship is leaving tonight
 
We're making a plan, we're dreaming a dream
We're fighting forward, despite head wind and current
Towards what we want so badly
Then suddenly we see
That the ship is leaving tonight
Yes, the ship is leaving tonight
 
Evening in the sign of the new moon
Two standing in the dark on the quay
Girl and man
One from the sea, one from land
Everything is said, now they're just standing there
In silence
Finally she says:
