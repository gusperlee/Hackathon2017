You, that I love
You made me so much sad
How to erase
The passing days?
 
So much sadness
Whole days long I'm hanging around
Begging to my remembrance
A little bit from you
 
Your voice in a dream
I remember
Whispered unremittingly
Didn't ask nothing
You were so tender
This summer night
How to forbid myself
To not listen?
 
Nobody any more
And my monotonous life
Is marking out every days
Without your love
Without you I'm shivering
 
Looking for your hand
In the autumn night
I'm hoping, in vain
And nevertheless really
 
My life inside of me
Scream to me: I only love
Only love you
So much sadness
You made me so much sad
 
But how to erase
The passing days?
Your voice, your lips
Imprisoned my fever
But how to erase
The passing days?
