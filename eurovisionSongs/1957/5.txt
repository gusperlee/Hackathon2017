She's back
The same things welcomed her
The same roses welcomed her
Sweet green eyed dream
She's back, but it's too late
Too late for the one who waited
 
Strings of my guitar
If my hand is trembling on a chord
If music fades away
In the indifference of a glance
 
Strings of my guitar
Why do you stop, why don't you play?
Only you, for me
Ah, how sweet this music was
Ah, and useless it seems now
If she won't listen to us, don't stop
Strings of my guitar
Play for me
 
Strings of my guitar
Why do you stop, why don't you play?
Only you, for me
Ah, how sweet this music was
Ah, and useless it seems now
If she won't listen to us, don't stop
Strings of my guitar
Play for me
 
Play, play
Strings of my guitar
She's back
The same things welcomed her
The same roses welcomed her
Sweet green eyed dream
She's back, but it's too late
Too late for the one who waited
 
Strings of my guitar
If my hand is trembling on a chord
If music fades away
In the indifference of a glance
