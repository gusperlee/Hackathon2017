Showing no emotion, my feelings locked inside
I made myself an island, trying to take my heart and hide
I built a wall around me, afraid of letting go
But suddenly an open door I never saw before
 
In your eyes (Your eyes)
I see the light leading me home again
It's heaven in your arms, my love
My heart is in your hands
(Heaven in your arms)
In your eyes (Your eyes)
Seems so right
I see forever in your smile
This woman is a child again
(In your eyes)
 
Love's been building bridges between your heart and mine
I'm safe here on my island, but I'm out on the edge this time
I built a wall around me, thought I'd save myself the pain
Your touch swept me away, now I'll never play it safe again
 
In your eyes (Your eyes)
I see the light leading me home again
It's heaven in your arms, my love
My heart is in your hands
(Heaven in your arms)
In your eyes (Your eyes)
Seems so right
I see forever in your smile
This woman is a child again
 
I've never been this close
How do I know love will survive?
I'm walking a tightrope
Here, in your arms, I'm alive
 
I'm in your eyes (Your eyes)
I see the light
I see forever in your smile
This woman is a child again
 
I'm in your eyes (In your eyes)
(I see the light leading me home again)
I see the light, I see the light
(It's heaven in your arms, my love)
(My heart is in your hands)
Whoa...
(In your eyes, feels so right)
I see forever in your smile
This woman is a child again
When I look in your eyes
