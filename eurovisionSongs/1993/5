When I meet you in the street
And you stop and smile this strange smile
And you stand there, pretending nothing has happened
Afraid to meet my glance
No one can see it only you and I know it

When I meet you in the evening
And you look at me with this strange light
And you gently touch me
On the hand as you walk past me
No one must see it, only you and I know it

All my thoughts, they fly to you
All my dreams are open
In all my rooms, I can only see you
You are lying in my bed sleeping

When you're among your friends
And your beautiful laughter melts my skin
And you pretend you've never seen me before
You are like a distant and cool god
No one must see it, only you and I know it

All my thoughts, they fly to you
All my dreams are open
In all my rooms, I can only see you
You are lying in my bed sleeping

All my thoughts, they fly to you
All my dreams are open
In all my rooms, I can only see you
You are lying in my bed sleeping, sleeping
