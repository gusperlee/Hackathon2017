You, gentlemen, wind sellers
You, trainers of performing dogs
Magicians, snake charmers
Dust in the eyes for children
On the great ball of fake dreams
Where the stage is erected
The guitars play in vain
I won't come dancing

Out of question to burn my wings
Out of question to follow your steps
I don't have time
And if tomorrow luck is with me
First of all, I want to be myself
Quite simply myself

You, gentlemen, money makers
You, the false-talent seekers
Puppets in appearance
Golden records and blank cheques
In the palace of vanities
Limousins and publicity
All your flashlights crackle in vain
I won't come prancing

Out of question to burn my wings
Out of question to follow your steps
I don't have time
And if tomorrow luck is with me
First of all, I want to be myself
Quite simply myself

Out of question to burn my wings
Out of question to follow your steps
I don't have time
Don't have time
And if tomorrow luck is with me
First of all, I want to be myself
Quite simply myself
Quite simply

And if tomorrow luck is with me
Before all, I want to be myself
Quite simply myself
