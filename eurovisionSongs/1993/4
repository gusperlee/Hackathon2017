She always has a little wine
Some fruits, a bit of bread
For the starving friends
Mama Corsica

Her heart is as wide as the sky
She's as sincere as she's beautiful
Mama Corsica

She's like those old ladies in black
Who bear their story inside themselves
Mama Corsica

It even seems that the Good Lord
Was crazy in love with her
Drawing her with his fingers

Mama Corsica, tonight we're singing in Corsican for you
Mama Corsica, on behalf of love and friendship
Mama Corsica, tonight the world has only eyes for you
Mama Corsica, as if the world sung in Corsican to greet you

She always prays for her boys
When they are far from home
Mama Corsica

She smiles when you're thinking of her
She likes it when you're faithful to her
Mama Corsica

Don't believe everything what people say
Basically it's her who unites us
Mama Corsica

Never mind that there are differences
She doesn't have preferences
All her children have Corsican blood

Mama Corsica, tonight we're singing in Corsican for you
Mama Corsica, on behalf of love, tonight you're the land of friendship
Mama Corsica, tonight the world has only eyes for you
Mama Corsica, as if the world sung in Corsican to greet you

Mama Corsica
