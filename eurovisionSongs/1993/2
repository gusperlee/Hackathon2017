(It's better the devil, devil)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah...)
(It's better the devil, devil)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah...)
 
Baby, don't do things that make me blue
You know my love is always true
Baby, don't do things that make me cry
I just can't seem to sleep at night
 
You know I love him every day
It breaks my heart when he goes away
(Yeah, yeah, yeah...)
 
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't
Aha... aha...
I'll give you my heart and my soul if you give me your love
Aha... aha...
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't
 
I tell him that I love him most every day
I'm out of my head, I don't know what to say
He never plays around like the other guys do
He's got the key to my heart and my love is true
 
You know I love him every day
It breaks my heart when he goes away
(Yeah, yeah, yeah...)
 
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't
Aha... aha...
I'll give you my heart and my soul if you give me your love
Aha... aha...
 
(Oh no...) Don't tell me lies boy
(Oh no...) Don't make me cry
(Oh no...) Don't tell me lies boy
(Oh no...) Don't say goodbye
Better the devil (better the devil)
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't
 
You know I love him every day
It breaks my heart when he goes away
(Yeah, yeah, yeah...)
 
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't
Aha... aha...
I'll give you my heart and my soul if you give me your love
Aha... aha...
 
(Better the devil you know than the devil you don't)
Oh... (aha... aha...) oh yeah...
(I'll give you my heart and my soul if you give me your love)
Better the devil (aha... aha...), better the devil
 
(Better the devil you know than the devil you don't)
(Aha... aha...) yeah...
(I'll give you my heart and my soul if you give me your love)
I'll give you my heart
(Aha... aha...) Ooh baby...
