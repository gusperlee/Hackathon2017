No one knows who she is
No one dares to go too close
Where she stands with loud cries
And large eyes that never meet ours
She looks into forgotten lands
People believe she has lost her mind

She is among those guarding the flame (for our earth)
One of those keeping the branches together (for our earth)
She sees that the earth is our mother, stand guard, for our earth

Everyone looks in another direction
The chattering dies out, we exchange glances and smile
Her screams are without skin
She carries a message from the earth

She is among those guarding the flame (for our earth)
One of those keeping the branches together (for our earth)

She is among those struggling in the current (for our earth)
One of those who never wake from the dream (for our earth)
She sees that the earth is our mother
(Stand guard) and let the flame burn
(Stand guard) no matter what happens
(Stand guard) For our earth
