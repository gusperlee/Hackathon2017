Do you know the kind of person
Who knows everything for certain
And who likes trampling on you
When you lie down
He whistles if it turns out that you're at fault
Then he says gloatingly, and infuriatingly
With his silly laugh:

Don't you see, that's what I told you?
Do you agree or what?
And who's the smartest of us?
Don't you see, that's what I told you?
Maybe you'd better
Listen a little to me, I'd claim
It's not because I like to give in
I think I deserve that credit
But don't you see, that's what I told you?
I definitely think I'd agree with you
If only you were me

I won't name anybody by their name
But you do know
I thinking of one particular person
It's someone you know fairly well
And with a bit of luck
You should be able to guess it
And if it the right one
Then you can say to yourself:

Don't you see, that's what I told you?
Do you agree or what?
And who's the smartest of us?
Don't you see, that's what I told you?
Maybe you'd better
Listen a little to me, I'd claim
It's not because I like to give in
I think I deserve that credit
But don't you see, that's what I told you?
I definitely think I'd agree with you
If only you were me

You walk around as in a trance
And if you get your chance
Then I know for sure
That I'll be the target
Because you'll tease me and say
(You'll tease and tease), then I'll say:

Don't you see, that's what I told you?
Do you agree or what?
And who's the smartest of us?
Don't you see, that's what I told you?
Maybe you'd better
Listen a little to me, I'd claim
It's not because I like to give in
I think I deserve that credit
But don't you see, that's what I told you?
I definitely think I'd agree with you
If only you were me
