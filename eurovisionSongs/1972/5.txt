\f0\fs24 \cf0 Don't stay in the woods, butterfly\
And don't fly astray at night\
The moon is wrong, its shadows\
In the dawn are not a help\
Don't stay in the woods\
Don't stay in the woods\
Don't stay in the woods\
\
Dance around the lights, butterfly\
Your colours flame up\
The night is dead, in your dance\
Life is bright like the day\
Don't fall into the sun\
Don't fall into the sun\
Don't fall into the sun\
\
Butterfly in the wind, like the time passing by\
Like sand in the hand, blown away, burnt\
Don't you hear it? A wing breaks\
A whisper promises the light\
\
Your day is bright, so dance quickly\
It lasts just a wingbeat\
Dance around the lights, butterfly\
Soon the evening fog will come\
Don't fall into the sun\
Don't fall into the sun\
Don't fall into the sun\
\
Butterfly in the wind, like the time passing by\
Like sand in the hand, blown away, burnt\
Don't you hear it? A wing breaks\
A whisper promises the light\

Butterfly in the wind, like the time passing by\
