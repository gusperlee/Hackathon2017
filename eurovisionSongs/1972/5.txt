Don't stay in the woods, butterfly
And don't fly astray at night
The moon is wrong, its shadows
In the dawn are not a help
Don't stay in the woods
Don't stay in the woods
Don't stay in the woods

Dance around the lights, butterfly
Your colours flame up
The night is dead, in your dance
Life is bright like the day
Don't fall into the sun
Don't fall into the sun
Don't fall into the sun

Butterfly in the wind, like the time passing by
Like sand in the hand, blown away, burnt
Don't you hear it? A wing breaks
A whisper promises the light

Your day is bright, so dance quickly
It lasts just a wingbeat
Dance around the lights, butterfly
Soon the evening fog will come
Don't fall into the sun
Don't fall into the sun
Don't fall into the sun

Butterfly in the wind, like the time passing by
Like sand in the hand, blown away, burnt
Don't you hear it? A wing breaks
A whisper promises the light

Butterfly in the wind, like the time passing by
Like sand in the hand, blown away, burnt
Don't you hear it? A wing breaks
A whisper promises the light
