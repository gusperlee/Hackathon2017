\f0\fs24 \cf0 Only love lets us live\
Days in bright sunshine\
Which only love can give us\
Only those who love will never be lonely\
\
We're waiting and we're hoping and we're dreaming\
The day goes by and takes our dreams along\
The night is long and you're not with me\
But my heart, it finds its way to you\
\
Only love lets us live\
Forget and forgive everything\
Then you'll be forgiven again\
Only those who love will never be lonely\
\
Only love lets us live\
Days in bright sunshine\
Which only love can give us\
Only those who love will never be lonely\
\
I knew the paths that we travel\
Would be complicated, and that there would be tears\
That doesn't matter anymore, have you seen the goal?\
You'll walk along the road of your desire\
\
Only love lets us live\
Forget and forgive everything\
Then you'll be forgiven again\
Only those who love will never be lonely\
\
Only love lets us live\
Days in bright sunshine\
Which only love can give us\
Only those who love will never be lonely\
\
Only love lets us live\
Days in bright sunshine\
Which only love can give us\
Only those who love will never be lonely}
