Only love lets us live
Days in bright sunshine
Which only love can give us
Only those who love will never be lonely

We're waiting and we're hoping and we're dreaming
The day goes by and takes our dreams along
The night is long and you're not with me
But my heart, it finds its way to you

Only love lets us live
Forget and forgive everything
Then you'll be forgiven again
Only those who love will never be lonely

Only love lets us live
Days in bright sunshine
Which only love can give us
Only those who love will never be lonely

I knew the paths that we travel
Would be complicated, and that there would be tears
That doesn't matter anymore, have you seen the goal?
You'll walk along the road of your desire

Only love lets us live
Forget and forgive everything
Then you'll be forgiven again
Only those who love will never be lonely

Only love lets us live
Days in bright sunshine
Which only love can give us
Only those who love will never be lonely

Only love lets us live
Days in bright sunshine
Which only love can give us
Only those who love will never be lonely
