Na nana nanana nana...
What shall I do
To be yours today already?
Na, na-na, na-na-na, na-na
What would you do
To be mine today already?

Hey, should I be original
Or is it too early for that?
Just act normal
That's crazy enough already
Na nana nanana nana...
There's still the question
Am I yours or are you mine?

Ah, how difficult it is to be an honest person
When it's all about making a pass
You can't always say what you're really feeling
You're afraid to make a blunder

Yes, people, just act normal
We're crazy enough as it is
Especially when it's about love

Na nana nanana nana...
What shall I do
To be yours today already?
Na nana nanana nana...
What would you do
To be mine today already?

Oh oh oh, should I be original
Or is it too early for that?
Just act normal
That's crazy enough already
Na nana nanana nana...
There's still the question
Am I yours or are you mine?

Ah, how difficult it is to be an honest person
When it's all about love
You can't always say what you're really feeling
You're afraid to make a blunder

Yes, people, just act normal
We're crazy enough as it is
Especially when it's about love

Na nana nanana nana...
What shall I do
To be yours today already?
Na nana nanana nana...
Nana nana...
Nana nanana nanana...

Na nana nanana nana...
Nana nana...
Nana nanana nanana...
Nana nananana nanana...
