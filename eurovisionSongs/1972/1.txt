You go away, love has for you the smile of another
I would want to, but can't be mad at you
From now on, you'll forget me
It's not your fault, but still you should know

That after you, I couldn't live anymore
I would only live remembering you
After you, I'll have wet eyes
Empty hands, a joyless heart

With you, I've learnt to laugh
And my laughs only came by you
After you, I'll only be the shadow
Of your shadow, after you

Even if I settle down one day
If I keep the promise that unites two beings for always
After you, I could perhaps give my tenderness
But not my love anymore

After you, I couldn't live anymore
I would only live remembering you
After you, I'll have wet eyes
Empty hands, a joyless heart

With you, I've learnt to laugh
And my laughs only came by you
After you, I'll only be the shadow
Of your shadow, after you
