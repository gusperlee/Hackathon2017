You go away, love has for you the smile of another\
I would want to, but can't be mad at you\
From now on, you'll forget me\
It's not your fault, but still you should know\
\
That after you, I couldn't live anymore\
I would only live remembering you\
After you, I'll have wet eyes\
Empty hands, a joyless heart\
\
With you, I've learnt to laugh\
And my laughs only came by you\
After you, I'll only be the shadow\
Of your shadow, after you\
\
Even if I settle down one day\
If I keep the promise that unites two beings for always\
After you, I could perhaps give my tenderness\
But not my love anymore\
\
After you, I couldn't live anymore\
I would only live remembering you\
After you, I'll have wet eyes\
Empty hands, a joyless heart\
\
With you, I've learnt to laugh\
And my laughs only came by you\
After you, I'll only be the shadow\
Of your shadow, after you\cell \lastrow\row}
