You know I'll beg, steal or borrow
I'll bring you love
 
I look at you (I look at you)
And I see what I've been looking for (I'm looking for)
Now it's very clear to me
We should be together
 
You make me feel (You make me feel)
I could reach for the impossible
And knowing how much you care
I'll be there forever
 
You know I'll beg, steal or borrow
To give you sunny days
And in a hundred ways
I'll bring you love
 
You know I'll beg, steal or borrow (Yes, I will)
To make your garden grow
And most of all you know
I'll bring you love, love
 
I always knew (I always knew)
That the world could be a finer place (A finer place)
So what if I have to wait?
Better late than never
 
You, you're like me (You're so like me)
'Cause you believe love makes it all worthwhile (All worthwhile)
And although we've just begun
We'll go on forever
 
You know I'll beg, steal or borrow
To give you sunny days
And in a hundred ways
I'll bring you love
 
You know I'll beg, steal or borrow
To make your garden grow
And most of all you know
I'll bring you love, yeah... love
 
You know I'll beg, steal or borrow
To give you sunny days
And in a hundred ways
I'll bring you love, love, love, yeah
Love, love, love
