Song # 1

It's a dirty money track, yeah
Girls, kick the flow
Listen to me
All my girls, get ready
We'll make it easy
 
When I catch you pickin' me
You better get a chill
Boy, you wanna take on me
'Cause I'm your killin' pill
 
Can't you see the way I move
My dress, my flashy skin?
Listen up, you know I got
The place you've never been
 
Slow down (Slow down)
Boy, you don't wanna let me down
You better stop, you know what?
 
Oh, don't call me funny bunny
I'll blow your money, money
I'll get you to my bad ass spinnin' for you
Oh, I'll make it easy, honey
I'll take your money, yummy
I've got my bitches standin' up next to me
 
So come and check it
So come and check it
So come and check it
My bad ass spinnin' for you
 
So come and check it
So come and check it
So come and check it
My bad ass spinnin' for you (Watch out)
 
Keep on takin' over you
It's kinda gettin' free
Baby boy, you know I still
Got sexy freak in me
 
Gotta tease you, nasty guy
So take it, don't be shy
Put your cherry on my cake
And taste my cherry pie
 
Slow down (Slow down)
Boy, you don't wanna let me down
You better stop, you know what?
 
Oh, don't call me funny bunny
I'll blow your money, money
I'll get you to my bad ass spinnin' for you
Oh, I'll make it easy, honey
I'll take your money, yummy
I've got my bitches standin' up next to me
 
Maybe I'll take you with me tonight
Maybe you'll show me another way
And find a reason for me to stay
But something I must tell you:
 
Feel my vibration
Get it
 
Oh, don't call me funny bunny
I'll blow your money, money
I'll get you to my bad ass spinnin' for you
Oh, I'll make it easy, honey
I'll take your money, yummy
I've got my bitches standin' up next to me
 
So come and check it
So come and check it
So come and check it
My bad ass spinnin' for you
 
So come and check it
So come and check it
So come and check it
My bad ass spinnin' for you
