I can't close my eyes
The empty bed chases sleep away
And my life is melting away
And it's disappearing quickly, in a split second

It seems I'm losing my mind
As I don't even notice reality
I still love you
I still trust you blindly

Like crazy, I don't know where to go
I'm afraid of a new love
And the days are like open wounds
I don't count them anymore

Prayer, like ardour on my lips
Prayer, just your name, instead of words
Heaven knows, just as I do
How many times I've repeated this
Heaven knows, just as I do
That your name is my only prayer

But I can't lie to God
As long as I pray
And I'd be lying if I said
That I don't love you

Prayer, like ardour on my lips
Prayer, just your name, instead of words
Heaven knows, just as I do
How many times I've repeated this
Heaven knows, just as I do
That your name is my prayer
(Prayer, prayer)

And heaven knows, just as I do
How many times I've repeated this
Heaven knows, just as I do
That your name is my only prayer

That your name is my prayer

Time is here tonight
You should make it right
To end our fight
Just hold me tight

Let's go...
Let's go...

(Let's go, let's go, let's go...)

Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go...

Time is here tonight
You should make it right
To end our fight
Just hold me tight

(Let's, let's, let's, let's go)
