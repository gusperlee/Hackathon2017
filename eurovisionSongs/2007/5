Welcome to the night and you will see
You've got the magic power
I am on my way, I keep the key to your tower
 
You can serve me something really hot
Call it love or madness
But you'll get the best of what I've got
 
Work your magic
I never wanna lose this feeling
I am able and I'm willing
Yes, I'm willing
 
Work your magic
You set my beating heart in motion
When you cast your loving potion
Loving potion
 
Work your magic
I never wanna lose this feeling
I am able and I'm willing
Yes, I'm willing
 
Work your magic
You set my beating heart in motion
When you cast your loving potion over me
 
Baby, you can put your spell on me
Makin' it slow and steady
Maybe I can solve your mystery
Are you ready?
 
We are standing closely skin to skin
Playin' a very old game
In this game of love, you always win
 
Work your magic
I never wanna lose this feeling
I am able and I'm willing
Yes, I'm willing
 
Work your magic
You set my beating heart in motion
When you cast your loving potion over me
 
When you cast your loving potion over me
 
So you work your magic
Baby, work your magic
Keep my heart forever bound
 
Work your magic
I never wanna lose this feeling
I am able and I'm willing
Yes, I'm willing
 
Work your magic
You set my beating heart in motion
When you cast your loving potion over me
