Lo, a young lass, eeh...

Lo, lo, she sings, eeh...
Lo, Mitra sings by the river
Oh Mitra, eeh.. oh Mitra
Lo, by the river, beyond the forest
Oh Mitra, eeh... oh Mitra

Lo, coming from the village, a reckless lad
Oh Mitra, eeh... oh Mitra
Lo, a reckless lad, leading a pony
Oh Mitra, eeh... oh Mitra

Lo, lo, she sings
Lo, lo, eeh...
Oh Mitra
Eno ho... ho... ho...
Ah... ah... ah...

Lo, a reckless lad, riding his pony
Oh Mitra, eeh... oh Mitra
Lo, riding his pony, loving his lass
Oh Mitra, eeh... oh Mitra

Tara-doo-da dai-doo-dara dara-doo-da, oh Mitra

Tara-doo-dai doo-dara dara-doo-da... (Hey...)
Tara-doo-dai doo-dara dara-doo-da...
Tara-doo-dai doo-dara dara-doo-da... (Hey, hey...)
Tara-doo-dai doo-dara dara-doo-da...

Tara-doo-dai doo-dara dara-doo-da... (Hey...)
Tara-doo-dai doo-dara dara-doo-da... (Hey, hey...)
Tara-doo-dai doo-dara dara-doo-da... (Hey...)
Tara-doo-dai doo-dara dara-doo-da..
(Prayer, prayer)

And heaven knows, just as I do
How many times I've repeated this
Heaven knows, just as I do
That your name is my only prayer

That your name is my prayer

Time is here tonight
You should make it right
To end our fight
Just hold me tight

Let's go...
Let's go...

(Let's go, let's go, let's go...)

Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go...

Time is here tonight
You should make it right
To end our fight
Just hold me tight

(Let's, let's, let's, let's go)
