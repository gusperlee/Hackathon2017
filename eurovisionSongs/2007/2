(Shake it, shake it)
(Shake it, shake it)
 
She smiled at me, said: "Would you like it sweet and low?"
"I know a place where we can take it nice and slow"
I know what you're thinkin': don't stop, I need that sweet thing
Telling you now, this is real
 
Shake it up, şekerim, I know what you're feelin'
Shake it up, şekerim, I got what you're needin'
Shake it up, şekerim, tell me what you're thinkin'
Shake it up, şekerim, you're my only sweet thing
 
She said in a sexy lazy low key: "Can I make it right?"
You put your trust in me, I'll take you through the night
Don't keep me waiting, not sure you're understanding
Just how much I crave for you
 
Shake it up, şekerim, I know what you're feelin'
Shake it up, şekerim, I got what you're needin'
Shake it up, şekerim, tell me what you're thinkin'
Shake it up, şekerim, you're my only sweet thing
 
Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time
I got lots of candy to make you mine
Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time
I got lots of candy for you
 
Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time
I got lots of candy to make you mine
Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time
I got lots of candy for you
 
Shake it up, şekerim, I know what you're feelin'
Shake it up, şekerim, I got what you're needin'
Shake it up, şekerim, tell me what you're thinkin'
Shake it up, şekerim, you're my only sweet thing
 
Shake it up, şekerim (Shake it up, şekerim)
Shake it up, şekerim, you're my only sweet thing
Shake it up, şekerim, tell me what you're thinkin'
Shake it up, şekerim, you're my only sweet thing
 
Shake it up, şekerim
