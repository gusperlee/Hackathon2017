I know an old man, someone who has lived for a long time
I know an old man, someone who has lived for a long time
He's so kind asking me what has happened to me
And if the sun had burnt me
 
I talk and seek comfort, he rocks in his chair
He says with a broken voice: "There's nothing new under the sun"
 
But what does it matter if things happened before me?
But what does it matter if things happened before me?
No, what makes me hurt so much with all that he knew
That his eyes were sad
 
What can expect myself in that rocking chair?
When he's so sad there now, there's nothing new under the sun
