Once upon a time there was
A pig breeder, a really cool man
And a princess, a proud maiden she was
One day they met and he stepped up to her and said:
 
Gosh almighty, you seem to be a cool lady
Look at that dress, really happening
Is there a fancy dress party or something?
Get lost, you're such a peasant
I'm a princess, rather prudish
My name is Cunigunda, the king's sweetheart
Hey, take it easy, chill out
Listen to me drumming on my saucepan
 
Dig dig pop...
 
Oops, such a groovy tune you drummed just there
If you teach me how to drum you can kiss me
Every girl has a mouth, what about a coin instead?
I drink from the brook, I eat soil
If you have a coin in your pocket you're better off
You're such a cheeky devil, you won't get any gold
But I want to drum on your saucepan
 
Dig dig pop...
 
Bang, gosh, the girl's in a hurry
What's so special about it? There are lots of saucepans
That saucepan sounds groovy, a cool sound, a nice ring to it
Let's make a deal, take it or leave it
I'll be a hip pig breeder, and you can be the king's sweetheart
Me as a princess? Sure, I'm hip
Then take my drum, take my saucepan
 
He, as a princess, a hip man wearing clip-on ties
Was thrown out of the castle by the guards
She, as a pig breeder, a prudish chick wearing a tie
Drove everybody mad, playing her saucepan
Trading your saucepan turned out to be a really bad idea
