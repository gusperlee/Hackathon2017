A bit of pepper, a bit of salt
A bit of love, a bit of honey
When this all will be mixed together
You'll finally be able to say that it happened
 
He always passed me right under my nose
I didn't exist for him
He couldn't know that my big love
Flourished not far from him
 
To the local sorceress
I could finally tell about him
She looked at me for a long, long time
And this is what she told me
 
"A bit of pepper, a bit of salt"
"A bit of love, a bit of honey"
"When this all will be mixed together"
"You'll finally be able to say that it happened"
 
I followed with no further explanation
The advice she gave me
To win the love of this beautiful boy
I wanted to try everything
 
I've bought a brandy
At one hundred and twenty-one degrees
And strongly thinking about him
I've added bravely
 
A bit of pepper, a bit of salt
A bit of love, a bit of honey
When that all was mixed together
What had to happen, happened
 
Tom topo tom tom tom to tom...
Tom topo tom tom tom to tom...
 
Upon a beautiful day he came to me
My mother invited him
I gave him my herb tea to drink
And after that, everything changed
 
I love him, he loves me, we love each other
As in a fairy tale
To hold a boy dear
It's enough to give him
 
A bit of pepper, a bit of salt
A bit of love, a bit of honey
 
A bit op pepper, a bit of salt
