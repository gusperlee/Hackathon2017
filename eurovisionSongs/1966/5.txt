My love, I need your touch
I need your love so very much
Since you went away
I cried for you each night and day
 
The day you went away
I said I didn't mind
Now I know that you have left
A broken heart behind
 
Please, come back to stay
And promise me you'll never stray
I promise I'll be true
And that I'll never make you blue
 
For no one else can take your place
Your smile, your lips, your eyes, your face
Please, darling, oh please
Come back to me to stay
 
Please, come back to stay
And promise me you'll never stray
I promise that I'll be true
And that I'll never make you blue
 
For no one else can take your place
Your smile, your lips, your eyes, your face
Please, darling, oh please
Come back to me to stay
 
Oh darling, please come back to stay
