Thank you, thank you, thank you
For the hours darling, darling, darling
Our love was beautiful, so beautiful
Thank you, darling
Don't be sad, as I have to leave you
 
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Your tears are painful, so painful, so painful
Our dream flies away, away
Thank you, darling
Don't cry, also that serves a useful purpose
 
Look ahead, not back
You can't force luck
Because no sea is as wild as love
Only love can be like that
Be like that, be like that
 
Thank you, thank you, thank you
For the hours, darling, darling, darling
Our love was beautiful, so beautiful
Thank you, darling
 
So beautiful, so beautiful
Thank you, darling
So beautiful, so beautiful
Thank you, darling
Thank you
