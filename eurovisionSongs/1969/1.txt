(Pa para para papa...)
(Pa para para papa...)

How many nights I wandered
Through a thousand endless paths?
How many nights I kept silent
About what I wanted to say?
A deep hope
And a faraway echo was talking about you

Since you arrived, I don't live crying
I live singing, I live dreaming
I just want you to tell me what's happening
Because I'm trembling when I'm by your side

Since you arrived, I don't live crying (hey)
I live singing (hey), I live dreaming (hey)
But I wonder how long I could keep
Your love deep inside of me

(Pa para para papa...)
(Pa para para papa...)

Since you arrived, I don't live crying (hey)
I live singing (hey), I live dreaming (hey)
But I wonder how long I could keep
Your love deep inside of me

Pa la lala lala lala lala lalala

I live singing (hey), I live dreaming (hey)
I just want you to tell me what's happening
Because I'm trembling when I'm by your side
Because I'm trembling when I'm by your side

(Pa para para papa...)
(Pa para para papa...)

(Hey, hey)
