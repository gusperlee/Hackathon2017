A day will dawn upon three branches of lilac
That a child will watch like a picture book
The world around him will be empty, and it's like this
That he'll invent life on his first page:

Drawing the shape of an orange
He'll give the sky its first sun
Drawing the bird, he'll invent the flower
Looking for the sound of water, he'll hear the heartfelt cry

Drawing the rays of a star
The child will find the road of grown-ups
Grown-ups who kept a surprising look
For everyday fruit and for the roses of love
