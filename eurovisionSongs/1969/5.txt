\f0\fs24 \cf0 Good day, good day, it's wonderful to see you once again\
Good day, good day, especially today the sun shines so beautifully\
My only wish is to walk through the town led by your hand\
Good day, good day\
\
The sky laughs like my heart, when you love me dearly\
Flowers are blooming, where previously could be found street dust\
A bird sings for us in a minor and a major key:\
"Good day, good day"\
\
The world is wonderful, it can't be more beautiful\
And it only belongs to the lovers\
\
Good day, good day, it's wonderful to see you once again\
Good day, good day, only with you the sun shines so beautifully\
My experience with you, that's all love\
Good day, good day\
\
"Good day, good day", says everybody, who sees you and me\
Good day, good day, the clock chimes and it stops for us\
Soon a monument will take off his hat, that's what I'm waiting for\
Good day, good day\
\
The world is wonderful, it can't be more beautiful\
And it only belongs to the lovers\
\
"Good day, good day", fortune says and it comes to us\
In your arms I fly into the sky\
Inspite I also know, that after the lucky time\
Only loneliness will remain\
\
Good evening, good evening, it was wonderful to see you once again\
Though it's hard for me to leave you such in love\
I dream of you till you come back and then I only say:\
"Good day, good day"}
