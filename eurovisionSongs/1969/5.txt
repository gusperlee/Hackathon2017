Good day, good day, it's wonderful to see you once again
Good day, good day, especially today the sun shines so beautifully
My only wish is to walk through the town led by your hand
Good day, good day

The sky laughs like my heart, when you love me dearly
Flowers are blooming, where previously could be found street dust
A bird sings for us in a minor and a major key:
"Good day, good day"

The world is wonderful, it can't be more beautiful
And it only belongs to the lovers

Good day, good day, it's wonderful to see you once again
Good day, good day, only with you the sun shines so beautifully
My experience with you, that's all love
Good day, good day

"Good day, good day", says everybody, who sees you and me
Good day, good day, the clock chimes and it stops for us
Soon a monument will take off his hat, that's what I'm waiting for
Good day, good day

The world is wonderful, it can't be more beautiful
And it only belongs to the lovers

"Good day, good day", fortune says and it comes to us
In your arms I fly into the sky
Inspite I also know, that after the lucky time
Only loneliness will remain

Good evening, good evening, it was wonderful to see you once again
Though it's hard for me to leave you such in love
I dream of you till you come back and then I only say:
"Good day, good day"
