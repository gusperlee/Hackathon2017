\f0\fs24 \cf0 He was bursting with music\
He sang for large and small public\
He changed happiness to melancholy\
The troubadour\
\
For knights in the Knight's Hall\
He sang in tough, strong language\
A long and bloody story\
The troubadour\
\
But also the workmen in the barn\
Heard his song full of adventure\
Heard nearby the nightly kitchenfire\
The troubadour, the troubadour\
\
And in the inn of the city\
He sang a drinking song on the dampness\
For those who could still stand and those who sat\
The troubadour, the troubadour\
\
La lalala lala lailala lailala...\
La lala lailala la...\
La lalala lala lailala lailala...\
La lala lailala la...\
\
He silently sung his song in monestries\
About a miracle that occurs\
Even if nobody sees the wonder\
The troubadour\
\
Women dressed in velvet or grey\
Whose hearts he sang into confusion\
His love song was brought along on trips\
The troubadour\
\
He sang for farmers on the land\
A fellow song he wrote himself\
He was from all walks of life\
The troubadour, the troubadour\
\
Like this he sang his whole life long\
His own song, his own singing\
But still death just goes its way\
The troubadour, the troubadour\
\
Then it went quiet, the song was ended\
Only some mud in conclusion\
But those who were comforted by his song\
Don't forget him\
\
Because he was bursting with music\
He sang for large and small public\
He changed happiness to melancholy\
The troubadour\
\
Oh oh... la lalala lala lailala lailala...\
La lala lailala la...\
La lalala lala lailala lailala...\
La lala lailala la...\
\
Oh... ala lalala lala lailala lailala...\
La lala lailala la...\
Ala lalala lala lailala lailala...\
La lala lailala la...\
Ala ho ho ho...}
