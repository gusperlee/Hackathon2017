He was bursting with music
He sang for large and small public
He changed happiness to melancholy
The troubadour

For knights in the Knight's Hall
He sang in tough, strong language
A long and bloody story
The troubadour

But also the workmen in the barn
Heard his song full of adventure
Heard nearby the nightly kitchenfire
The troubadour, the troubadour

And in the inn of the city
He sang a drinking song on the dampness
For those who could still stand and those who sat
The troubadour, the troubadour

La lalala lala lailala lailala...
La lala lailala la...
La lalala lala lailala lailala...
La lala lailala la...

He silently sung his song in monestries
About a miracle that occurs
Even if nobody sees the wonder
The troubadour

Women dressed in velvet or grey
Whose hearts he sang into confusion
His love song was brought along on trips
The troubadour

He sang for farmers on the land
A fellow song he wrote himself
He was from all walks of life
The troubadour, the troubadour

Like this he sang his whole life long
His own song, his own singing
But still death just goes its way
The troubadour, the troubadour

Then it went quiet, the song was ended
Only some mud in conclusion
But those who were comforted by his song
Don't forget him

Because he was bursting with music
He sang for large and small public
He changed happiness to melancholy
The troubadour

Oh oh... la lalala lala lailala lailala...
La lala lailala la...
La lalala lala lailala lailala...
La lala lailala la...

Oh... ala lalala lala lailala lailala...
La lala lailala la...
Ala lalala lala lailala lailala...
La lala lailala la...
Ala ho ho ho...
